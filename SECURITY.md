# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this framework or its templates, please report it responsibly.

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting (Security tab → **Report a vulnerability**), or contact the maintainers directly with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

- Acknowledgment within 48 hours
- Status update within 7 days
- Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

## Scope

This security policy covers:
- Documentation content that could lead to insecure implementations
- Template files (Excel) containing sensitive formulas or macros
- Example configurations that could expose systems

## Best Practices

When implementing this framework:
- Review all controls with your security team
- Validate configurations in non-production environments
- Follow your organization's change management processes
- Maintain audit trails for all implementations

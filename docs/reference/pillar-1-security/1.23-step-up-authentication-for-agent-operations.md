# Control 1.23: Step-Up Authentication for AI Agent Operations

## Overview

**Control ID:** 1.23
**Control Name:** Step-Up Authentication for AI Agent Operations
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), FINRA 4511, SOX 302/404, NIST SP 800-63B, Zero Trust Architecture
**Setup Time:** 3-5 hours

---

### Purpose

Implement step-up authentication requirements when AI agents attempt sensitive operations such as financial transactions, data exports, or access to restricted information. While Control 1.11 establishes baseline Conditional Access policies for agent authentication, this control defines operational workflows for triggering re-authentication when agents perform high-risk actions through plugins, connectors, or API calls.

!!! warning "Critical for Financial Transactions"
    Agents that can initiate or influence financial transactions, transfer customer data, or access confidential information must implement step-up authentication to verify the user's continued presence and authorization at the moment of action.

---

### Description

Step-Up Authentication for AI Agent Operations establishes controls to:

- **Define High-Risk Agent Actions:** Catalog actions that require re-authentication before execution
- **Configure Authentication Contexts:** Map sensitive actions to Entra ID Authentication Contexts
- **Implement Just-in-Time Verification:** Require fresh authentication for critical operations
- **Enforce Phishing-Resistant Methods:** Mandate strong authentication for high-risk scenarios
- **Audit Step-Up Events:** Log all step-up authentication requests and outcomes

See [Microsoft Entra Authentication Contexts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps#authentication-context) for platform capabilities.

## Governance Levels

### Baseline (Level 1)

| Requirement | Configuration |
|-------------|---------------|
| MFA enforcement | All agent interactions require MFA |
| Session limits | 8-hour session maximum |
| Documentation | Document high-risk actions |

**Minimum requirements:**

- Baseline MFA for all Copilot and agent access
- Document actions that would benefit from step-up authentication
- Standard session timeout policies
- Quarterly review of authentication requirements

### Recommended (Level 2-3)

| Requirement | Configuration |
|-------------|---------------|
| Authentication Contexts | Define contexts for sensitive actions |
| Step-up triggers | Configure triggers for financial/data actions |
| Fresh authentication | 15-minute max age for sensitive operations |
| Risk-based elevation | Require stronger auth when risk detected |

**FSI recommendations:**

- Configure Authentication Contexts for high-risk agent actions
- Implement step-up authentication for:
  - Financial transaction initiation
  - Customer data exports
  - External API calls with customer data
  - Agent configuration changes
- Require phishing-resistant MFA for step-up scenarios
- Monthly review of step-up authentication events

### Regulated/High-Risk (Level 4)

| Requirement | Configuration |
|-------------|---------------|
| Mandatory step-up | All sensitive actions require fresh auth |
| Continuous verification | Session verified before each high-risk action |
| Hardware token requirement | FIDO2/hardware key for critical operations |
| Real-time monitoring | Alert on step-up failures |

**FSI considerations (high-risk):**

- Step-up authentication mandatory for all Zone 3 agent operations
- Phishing-resistant MFA required (no SMS/phone call)
- Session maximum of 4 hours with step-up at each sensitive action
- Real-time alerting on step-up authentication failures
- Full audit trail preserved for regulatory examination
- Third-party validation of step-up controls

---

## Setup & Configuration

### Step 1: Define High-Risk Agent Actions

**Action Classification Framework:**

Identify actions that require step-up authentication based on risk level:

| Risk Level | Action Category | Examples | Step-Up Requirement |
|------------|-----------------|----------|---------------------|
| **Critical** | Financial Transactions | Trade execution, wire transfers, payment initiation | Always required |
| **Critical** | Data Export | Customer data download, bulk export, API extract | Always required |
| **High** | External Integration | CRM updates, third-party API calls with PII | Required |
| **High** | Configuration Changes | Agent permissions, connector settings, knowledge sources | Required |
| **Medium** | Sensitive Queries | Account balance, portfolio details, transaction history | Risk-based |
| **Low** | General Assistance | FAQ, general information, scheduling | Standard MFA |

**Agent Action Risk Assessment Template:**

```

### Step 2: Create Authentication Contexts in Entra ID

**Portal Path:** Microsoft Entra Admin Center → Protection → Conditional Access → Authentication Contexts

1. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra Admin Center** (entra.microsoft.com)
2. Go to **Protection** → **Conditional Access** → **Authentication Contexts**
3. Click **+ New authentication context**
4. Create contexts for agent operations:

**Recommended Authentication Contexts for FSI:**

| Context Name | ID | Description | Use Case |
|--------------|-----|-------------|----------|
| `c1` | AgentFinancialTransaction | Financial transaction operations | Trade execution, transfers |
| `c2` | AgentDataExport | Data export operations | Customer data, bulk exports |
| `c3` | AgentExternalAPI | External system calls | CRM, third-party APIs |
| `c4` | AgentConfigChange | Configuration modifications | Agent settings, permissions |
| `c5` | AgentSensitiveQuery | Sensitive data queries | Account details, balances |

**PowerShell Configuration:**

```powershell
# Connect to Microsoft Graph
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess"

# Create Authentication Context for Financial Transactions
$financialContext = @{
    DisplayName = "Agent Financial Transaction"
    Description = "Step-up authentication for AI agent financial operations"
    Id = "c1"
    IsAvailable = $true
}

# Note: Authentication contexts are created through the portal or Graph API
# This shows the configuration structure
Write-Host "Create authentication contexts in Entra Admin Center:"
Write-Host "  - c1: Agent Financial Transaction"
Write-Host "  - c2: Agent Data Export"
Write-Host "  - c3: Agent External API"
Write-Host "  - c4: Agent Config Change"
Write-Host "  - c5: Agent Sensitive Query"
```

### Step 3: Configure Conditional Access Policies for Step-Up

**Portal Path:** Microsoft Entra Admin Center → Protection → Conditional Access → Policies

**Policy 1: Step-Up for Financial Transactions**

1. Click **+ Create new policy**
2. Name: `FSI-Agent-StepUp-FinancialTransactions`
3. **Assignments:**
   - Users: All users (or specific groups with agent access)
   - Target resources: Authentication contexts → `c1` (Agent Financial Transaction)
4. **Conditions:**
   - Sign-in risk: Not configured (applies regardless of risk)
5. **Grant:**
   - Grant access
   - Require authentication strength: Phishing-resistant MFA
   - Require compliant device (recommended)
6. **Session:**
   - Sign-in frequency: 15 minutes (or every time)
7. Enable policy: **On**

**Policy 2: Step-Up for Data Export**

1. Create new policy: `FSI-Agent-StepUp-DataExport`
2. Target: Authentication context `c2`
3. Grant: Phishing-resistant MFA + Compliant device
4. Session: Sign-in frequency every 30 minutes

**Policy 3: Risk-Based Step-Up for Sensitive Queries**

1. Create new policy: `FSI-Agent-StepUp-RiskBased`
2. Target: Authentication context `c5`
3. **Conditions:**
   - Sign-in risk: Medium and above
   - User risk: Low and above
4. Grant: MFA required
5. Session: Sign-in frequency 1 hour

**PowerShell: Create Step-Up CA Policy**

```powershell
# Connect to Microsoft Graph
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess"

# Define policy for financial transactions step-up
$policyParams = @{
    DisplayName = "FSI-Agent-StepUp-FinancialTransactions"
    State = "enabledForReportingButNotEnforced"  # Start in report-only
    Conditions = @{
        Applications = @{
            IncludeAuthenticationContextClassReferences = @("c1")
        }
        Users = @{
            IncludeUsers = @("All")
        }
    }
    GrantControls = @{
        Operator = "AND"
        AuthenticationStrength = @{
            Id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004"  # Phishing-resistant MFA
        }
        BuiltInControls = @("compliantDevice")
    }
    SessionControls = @{
        SignInFrequency = @{
            Value = 15
            Type = "minutes"
            IsEnabled = $true
            AuthenticationType = "primaryAndSecondaryAuthentication"
        }
    }
}

# Create the policy
$policy = New-MgIdentityConditionalAccessPolicy -BodyParameter $policyParams
Write-Host "Created policy: $($policy.DisplayName)" -ForegroundColor Green

# Note: Test in report-only mode before enabling
Write-Host "Policy is in report-only mode. Review sign-in logs before enabling." -ForegroundColor Yellow
```

### Step 4: Integrate Step-Up with Power Platform Connectors

**Approach:** Configure custom connectors and actions to require specific authentication contexts.

**Custom Connector Authentication Configuration:**

For connectors that perform sensitive operations, configure OAuth to require step-up:

```yaml
# Custom Connector Definition (excerpt)
securityDefinitions:
  oauth2_auth:
    type: oauth2
    flow: accessCode
    authorizationUrl: https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
    tokenUrl: https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token
    scopes:
      User.Read: Read user profile
      FinancialOperations.Execute: Execute financial operations
    x-ms-authentication-context: c1  # Require financial transaction context
```

**Action-Level Step-Up Configuration:**

For built-in connectors, use DLP policies to block sensitive actions and route through step-up enabled alternatives:

1. **Block direct sensitive actions** in DLP policy
2. **Create custom connector** that wraps the action with step-up requirement
3. **Route sensitive operations** through the step-up connector

### Step 5: Implement Service Principal Step-Up for Agent Workloads

**Scenario:** When agents operate as service principals (for background operations), configure workload identity risk detection and step-up equivalent controls.

**Workload Identity Conditional Access (Preview):**

```powershell
# Configure Conditional Access for workload identities
# This applies to service principals used by agents

$workloadPolicy = @{
    DisplayName = "FSI-Agent-ServicePrincipal-HighRisk"
    State = "enabled"
    Conditions = @{
        Applications = @{
            IncludeApplications = @("ServicePrincipal")
        }
        ServicePrincipalRiskLevels = @("high", "medium")
    }
    GrantControls = @{
        Operator = "OR"
        BuiltInControls = @("block")
    }
}

# Note: Workload identity CA requires Entra ID P2
Write-Host "Configure workload identity policies in Entra Admin Center"
Write-Host "Block high-risk service principal sign-ins"
```

**Agent Workload Step-Up Equivalent:**

Since service principals cannot perform interactive MFA, implement compensating controls:

| Scenario | Compensating Control |
|----------|---------------------|
| High-risk SP sign-in detected | Block and alert; require human approval |
| Sensitive action initiated | Require approval workflow before execution |
| Unusual behavior detected | Pause operation and notify Security |
| After-hours operation | Require pre-authorization |

### Step 6: Configure Session Controls for Agent Interactions

**Portal Path:** Microsoft Entra Admin Center → Protection → Conditional Access → Session

**Session Control Configuration:**

| Control | Zone 1 | Zone 2 | Zone 3 |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Sign-in frequency** | 8 hours | 4 hours | 1 hour |
| **Persistent sessions** | Allowed | Disallowed | Disallowed |
| **Step-up for sensitive actions** | Optional | Required | Required |
| **App-enforced restrictions** | No | Yes | Yes |

**Defender for Cloud Apps Session Control (Level 4):**

For regulated environments, use Defender for Cloud Apps Conditional Access App Control:

1. Navigate to **Defender for Cloud Apps** portal
2. Go to **Control** → **Policies** → **Conditional Access App Control**
3. Create policy for session monitoring:
   - Monitor all agent-related activities
   - Block download of sensitive content without step-up
   - Require approval for bulk operations

### Step 7: Implement Step-Up Workflow for Agents

**Agent Step-Up Integration Pattern:**

```
User Invokes Agent → Agent Processes Request → Sensitive Action Detected?

                                                                       Execute Action           Block & Log
```

**Implementation in Power Automate:**

```yaml
# Step-Up Check Flow (Conceptual)
trigger:
  - agent_sensitive_action

steps:
  - action: check_authentication_context
    inputs:
      required_context: "c1"  # Financial transaction context
      max_age_minutes: 15

  - condition: auth_context_valid
    if_true:
      - execute_sensitive_action
    if_false:
      - return_step_up_required
      - log_step_up_request
```

### Step 8: Configure Monitoring and Alerting

**Step-Up Authentication Monitoring:**

```kql
// Monitor step-up authentication events
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where AuthenticationContextClassReferences has_any ("c1", "c2", "c3", "c4", "c5")
| extend StepUpContext = tostring(AuthenticationContextClassReferences)
| extend StepUpResult = iff(ResultType == 0, "Success", "Failure")
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, StepUpContext, StepUpResult, ResultDescription
| summarize
    TotalAttempts = count(),
    Successes = countif(StepUpResult == "Success"),
    Failures = countif(StepUpResult == "Failure")
    by StepUpContext, bin(TimeGenerated, 1h)
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

**Alert Configuration:**

| Alert | Condition | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Step-Up Failure Spike | >5 failures in 15 minutes | Alert Security team |
| Sensitive Action Without Step-Up | Action executed without required context | Alert Compliance |
| Bypass Attempt | Request for step-up waiver | Alert AI Governance Lead |
| After-Hours Sensitive Action | High-risk action outside business hours | Alert Security |

**PowerShell: Step-Up Audit Report**

```powershell
# Generate Step-Up Authentication Audit Report

Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "AuditLog.Read.All", "Directory.Read.All"

$startDate = (Get-Date).AddDays(-30).ToString("yyyy-MM-ddT00:00:00Z")
$endDate = (Get-Date).ToString("yyyy-MM-ddT23:59:59Z")

# Query sign-in logs with authentication context
$filter = "createdDateTime ge $startDate and createdDateTime le $endDate"
$signIns = Get-MgAuditLogSignIn -Filter $filter -All

$stepUpEvents = $signIns | Where-Object {
    $_.AuthenticationContextClassReferences -ne $null -and
    $_.AuthenticationContextClassReferences.Count -gt 0
}

$report = $stepUpEvents | ForEach-Object {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Timestamp = $_.CreatedDateTime
        User = $_.UserPrincipalName
        Application = $_.AppDisplayName
        AuthContext = ($_.AuthenticationContextClassReferences -join ", ")
        Result = if ($_.Status.ErrorCode -eq 0) { "Success" } else { "Failure" }
        ErrorDetail = $_.Status.FailureReason
        Location = "$($_.Location.City), $($_.Location.CountryOrRegion)"
        Device = $_.DeviceDetail.DisplayName
    }
}

$report | Export-Csv -Path ".\StepUp-Audit-$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').csv" -NoTypeInformation
Write-Host "Exported $($report.Count) step-up authentication events" -ForegroundColor Green

# Summary statistics
$summary = $report | Group-Object Result | Select-Object Name, Count
Write-Host "`nStep-Up Summary:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
$summary | Format-Table
```

## Financial Sector Considerations

### Regulatory Alignment

| Regulation | Requirement | How This Control Helps |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **GLBA 501(b)** | Customer information safeguards | Verifies user identity before sensitive data access |
| **FINRA 4511** | Books and records security | Ensures authorized access to financial records |
| **SOX 302/404** | Internal controls | Provides transaction-level authentication controls |
| **NIST 800-63B** | Digital identity guidelines | Implements AAL2/AAL3 for sensitive operations |
| **Zero Trust** | Continuous verification | Validates identity at moment of sensitive action |

### Zone-Specific Configuration

**Zone 1 (Personal Productivity):**

```yaml
Configuration:
  - Step-up authentication: Not required
  - Session timeout: 8 hours
  - Standard MFA: Required
Rationale: Personal productivity agents have limited risk exposure
```

**Zone 2 (Team Collaboration):**

```yaml
Configuration:
  - Step-up authentication: Required for data exports and external API calls
  - Authentication contexts: c2 (Data Export), c3 (External API)
  - Session timeout: 4 hours
  - Fresh auth for sensitive actions: 30 minutes
Rationale: Team agents may access shared data requiring additional verification
```

**Zone 3 (Enterprise Managed):**

```yaml
Configuration:
  - Step-up authentication: MANDATORY for all sensitive actions
  - Authentication contexts: c1-c5 (all contexts)
  - Session timeout: 1 hour
  - Fresh auth for sensitive actions: 15 minutes
  - Phishing-resistant MFA: Required
  - Device compliance: Required
  - Real-time monitoring: Enabled
Rationale: Customer-facing and transaction-capable agents require strictest controls
```

### FSI Implementation Example

**Scenario:** Trading Platform Agent with Order Execution Capability

**Step-Up Configuration:**

```yaml
agent_configuration:
  name: "Trading Assistant Agent"
  zone: 3
  risk_classification: "Critical"

  actions:
    - action: "view_portfolio"
      risk: "medium"
      auth_context: "c5"  # Sensitive query
      step_up_required: "risk_based"
      max_auth_age: "30m"

    - action: "execute_trade"
      risk: "critical"
      auth_context: "c1"  # Financial transaction
      step_up_required: "always"
      max_auth_age: "5m"
      additional_requirements:
        - "phishing_resistant_mfa"
        - "compliant_device"
        - "network_location_verified"

    - action: "export_trade_history"
      risk: "high"
      auth_context: "c2"  # Data export
      step_up_required: "always"
      max_auth_age: "15m"

  monitoring:
    step_up_failures: "alert_immediately"
    sensitive_actions: "log_all"
    after_hours_trades: "require_approval"
```

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>

### Issue: Step-Up Not Triggering for Sensitive Actions

**Symptoms:** Users can perform sensitive actions without re-authentication

**Resolution:**

1. Verify authentication context is correctly configured
2. Check CA policy targets the correct authentication context
3. Confirm application/connector is tagged to require the context
4. Review sign-in logs for context claim presence
5. Test with a new session (clear browser cache)

### Issue: Step-Up Blocking All Actions

**Symptoms:** Users cannot perform any agent operations

**Resolution:**

1. Review CA policy scope (may be too broad)
2. Check if session frequency is too aggressive
3. Verify user has compliant device (if required)
4. Confirm user has registered phishing-resistant MFA
5. Test with policy in report-only mode first

### Issue: Service Principal Operations Blocked

**Symptoms:** Background agent operations failing authentication

**Resolution:**

1. Service principals cannot do interactive MFA
2. Implement approval workflow for sensitive SP operations
3. Configure workload identity risk policies
4. Review service principal sign-in logs
5. Consider managed identity where possible

### Issue: Users Frustrated by Frequent Step-Ups

**Symptoms:** Complaints about too many authentication prompts

**Resolution:**

1. Review action classification (may be over-classified)
2. Extend session frequency for lower-risk actions
3. Ensure SSO is working correctly
4. Train users on the purpose of step-up
5. Consider risk-based step-up instead of always-on

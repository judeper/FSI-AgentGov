**Tabs:** Microsoft 365 | Fabric

### Three-Step Process

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **1. Identify** | Review assessments | Weekly results from default assessment or custom assessments |
| **2. Protect** | Apply controls | Limit Copilot access to sensitive data, apply labels and retention |
| **3. Monitor** | Ongoing review | SharePoint site and access reviews for permissions |

#### Oversharing assessment (evidence-grade) — what to run and what to keep

For US-only implementations, oversharing evidence should demonstrate (a) the assessment ran successfully, (b) overshared items were identified (or confirmed minimal), and (c) remediation was tracked.

1. Navigate to **DSPM for AI → Data risk assessments**.
2. Run the default assessment (if available) for the defined scope and wait for completion.
3. Review results and record:
    - Assessment name
    - Scope (sites/users/data sources included)
    - Run timestamp and completion timestamp
    - Overshared items count and severity (if shown)
4. Create a remediation record that ties findings to corrective actions (e.g., SharePoint permission cleanup, label application, DLP policy tightening).

**Verification artifacts (minimum):**
- Screenshot: assessment list showing status and completion time
- Screenshot: results summary showing overshared items count
- Change evidence: ticket(s) or work items for remediation, including before/after access state where feasible

### Custom Assessments (Preview)

Create targeted assessments for specific data sources:

1. Navigate to **DSPM for AI → Data risk assessments**
2. Click **+ Create custom assessment**
3. Define data sources and users to assess
4. Review results for overshared items
5. Take remediation actions

**Assessment tracking:** Name, Status, Started on, Completed on, Results expiry, Overshared items count

### Regulatory Context


**Primary Regulations:** FINRA Notice 25-07, SEC AI priorities, GLBA 501(a), SOX 302

| Regulation | DSPM for AI Support |
|------------|---------------------|
| FINRA 25-07 | AI supervision and monitoring requirements |
| SEC AI priorities | Transparency in AI-assisted decisions |
| GLBA 501(a) | Protection of customer information in AI |
| SOX 302 | Internal controls over AI systems |

### AI Regulation Compliance

DSPM for AI provides guided assistance for:
- **ISO 42001** - AI Management System standard
- **NIST AI RMF** - AI Risk Management Framework

### Examination Considerations

Regulators may request:
- AI interaction logs and audit trails
- Sensitive data exposure reports
- Policy configuration evidence
- Risk assessment results
- Remediation action documentation

---


### Zone-Specific Configuration


**Zone 1 (Personal Productivity):**
- Apply a baseline minimum of Microsoft Purview: DSPM for AI controls that impacts tenant-wide safety (where applicable), and document any exceptions for personal agents.
- Avoid expanding scope beyond the user’s own data unless explicitly justified.
- Rationale: reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low; legal/compliance can tighten later.

**Zone 2 (Team Collaboration):**
- Apply the control for shared agents and shared data sources; require an identified owner and an approval trail.
- Validate configuration in a pilot environment before broader rollout; retain evidence (screenshots/exports/logs).
- Rationale: shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied and provable.

**Zone 3 (Enterprise Managed):**
- Require the strictest configuration for Microsoft Purview: DSPM for AI controls and enforce it via policy where possible (not manual-only).
- Treat changes as controlled (change ticket + documented testing); retain evidence (screenshots/exports/logs).
- Rationale: enterprise agents handle the most sensitive content and are the highest audit/regulatory risk.

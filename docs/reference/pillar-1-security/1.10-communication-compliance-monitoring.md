# Control 1.10: Communication Compliance Monitoring

## Overview

**Control ID:** 1.10  
**Control Name:** Communication Compliance Monitoring  
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC Rule 17a-3, GLBA 501(b), FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-07  
**Setup Time:** 2-3 hours (initial); ongoing policy tuning  

---

### Purpose

Communication Compliance helps detect and review policy-relevant content in in-scope communications, including agent-assisted interactions (for example, user prompts and agent responses occurring in monitored Microsoft 365 workloads). This control is intended to support supervision and review objectives for U.S.-regulated financial services use cases; it does not, by itself, guarantee regulatory compliance.

For U.S. financial services, communication compliance monitoring commonly supports:

- **FINRA 4511/25-07**: Supervision of AI-assisted communications
- **SEC Rule 17a-3**: Retention and review of customer communications
- **GLBA 501(b)**: Protecting customer NPI in agent interactions
- **Investment Recommendations**: Monitoring for suitability violations
- **MNPI Detection**: Identifying potential insider trading communications
- **Conduct Risk**: Detecting inappropriate agent behavior

---

## Prerequisites

2. For each policy, configure:
   - **Initial review:** Analyst triage (24 hours)
   - **Escalation:** Investigator (if confirmed)
   - **Remediation options:**
     - Resolve (no violation)
     - Escalate to HR/Legal
     - Remediation required
       - Regulatory reporting consideration (as determined by Legal/Compliance; do not automate)

3. Document workflow:
   ```
   Alert Generated → Analyst Review (24h)
                  ↓
   Confirmed Violation?
   ├── No → Resolve + Document
   └── Yes → Escalate to Investigator
              ↓
        Investigation (48h)
              ↓
        Remediation Action
        ├── Training required
        ├── Disciplinary action
        ├── System change
      └── Regulatory reporting consideration
   ```

   **Case management minimums (recommended):**
   - Require a disposition and rationale for every alert (including “no violation”)
   - Require evidence attachment or reference (message excerpt, policy match reason, classifier hit)
   - Record timestamps for triage, escalation, and closure to demonstrate SLA adherence
   - Use a consistent severity taxonomy and escalation criteria across policies

## Financial Sector Considerations

### Regulatory Alignment

| Regulation | Communication Compliance Requirement |
|------------|-------------------------------------|
| **FINRA 4511** | Retain and supervise business communications |
| **FINRA 25-07** | Supervise AI-assisted communications |
| **SEC 17a-3/4** | Retain customer communications |
| **FINRA 3110** | Supervisory review of communications |
| **FINRA 2210** | Communications with the public |
| **Reg BI** | Best interest documentation |

**Caution (U.S. only):** Map these requirements to your firm’s specific obligations, products, and supervisory procedures. This control provides technical monitoring and review workflows; it does not replace written supervisory procedures (WSPs) or legal determination of reportability.

### Detection Scenarios for FSI

| Scenario | Keywords/Patterns | Priority |
|----------|-------------------|----------|
| **Unsuitable Recommendations** | "guaranteed", "risk-free", "can't lose" | Critical |
| **MNPI Indicators** | "before announcement", "inside information" | Critical |
| **Churning Indicators** | "trade more", "increase activity" | High |
| **Conflicts of Interest** | "my account", "personal trades" | High |
| **Customer Complaints** | "complaint", "dispute", "unhappy" | Medium |
| **Regulatory Inquiries** | "SEC", "FINRA", "subpoena" | High |

### Zone-Specific Configuration

## Verification & Testing

### Verification Steps

1. **Confirm Policies Active:**
   - Purview → Communication compliance → Policies
   - **EXPECTED:** All FSI policies listed and enabled

2. **Test Detection:**
   - Send test message matching policy conditions
   - **EXPECTED:** Alert generated within SLA

3. **Verify Reviewer Access:**
   - Log in as analyst, check alert queue
   - **EXPECTED:** Pending alerts visible

4. **Test Escalation:**
   - Escalate test alert
   - **EXPECTED:** Escalation notification sent

5. **Validate Audit Evidence (Dependency: Control 1.7):**
   - Confirm audit events exist for (a) policy creation/updates, (b) role assignment changes, and (c) reviewer actions/dispositions
   - **EXPECTED:** Unified audit log returns relevant events for the test period and can be exported

6. **Validate Retention (Dependency: Control 1.9):**
   - Confirm in-scope communications are retained per your retention configuration
   - **EXPECTED:** Content is retained and discoverable per policy and legal hold requirements

### Verification Evidence
- [ ] Screenshot(s): Policy configurations (scope, locations, conditions, reviewers, enabled state)

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>


### Issue: Policy Not Detecting Violations

**Symptoms:** Known violations not generating alerts

**Solutions:**

1. Verify policy is enabled
2. Check user scope includes target users
3. Verify location scope (Teams, email, etc.)
4. Review keyword/SIT configuration
5. Check classifier is enabled and trained (if using a trainable classifier)
6. Validate the message type is supported for monitoring in your tenant/licensing
7. Verify audit logs show the underlying activity (Dependency: Control 1.7)

### Issue: Too Many False Positives

**Symptoms:** High volume of non-violation alerts

**Solutions:**

1. Tune keyword lists (add exclusions)
2. Adjust sensitivity thresholds
3. Review and refine classifiers
4. Add context conditions
5. Sample-based review instead of 100%

**Evidence tip:** Track tuning changes with a change record and compare alert volumes before/after (retain exports).

### Issue: Reviewers Not Receiving Alerts

**Symptoms:** Alerts stuck in queue

**Solutions:**

1. Verify reviewer role assignments
2. Check email notifications configured
3. Verify reviewer mailbox is active
4. Review routing rules
5. Check for Teams notification issues
6. Confirm the reviewer can access Purview and the Communication compliance solution UI

### Issue: Copilot Conversations Not Captured

**Symptoms:** Agent interactions not appearing

**Solutions:**

1. Verify Copilot location is selected in policy
2. Check licensing for Copilot capture
3. Review audit log for Copilot events
4. Verify agent is integrated with monitored channel
5. Validate that the interaction type you expect is supported and being logged in your tenant
6. If needed, open a Microsoft support ticket with timestamps and example user IDs (avoid sharing sensitive content)

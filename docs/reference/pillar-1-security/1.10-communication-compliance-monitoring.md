## Financial Sector Considerations

Review Frequency: Weekly sampling
Escalation: HR only
Retention: 1 year
OCR: Optional
```

#### Zone 2 (Team Collaboration)
```
Monitoring: Standard (inappropriate + regulatory)
Review Frequency: Daily
Escalation: Compliance + HR
Retention: 3 years

3. **Verify Reviewer Access:**
   - Log in as analyst, check alert queue
   - **EXPECTED:** Pending alerts visible

4. **Test Escalation:**
   - Escalate test alert
   - **EXPECTED:** Escalation notification sent

5. **Validate Retention:**
   - Check communications are being captured
   - **EXPECTED:** Content retained per policy

### Compliance Evidence Checklist

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Policy Not Detecting Violations

**Symptoms:** Known violations not generating alerts

**Solutions:**
1. Verify policy is enabled
2. Check user scope includes target users
3. Verify location scope (Teams, email, etc.)
4. Review keyword/SIT configuration
5. Check classifier is enabled and trained

### Issue: Too Many False Positives

**Symptoms:** High volume of non-violation alerts

**Solutions:**
1. Tune keyword lists (add exclusions)
2. Adjust sensitivity thresholds
3. Review and refine classifiers
4. Add context conditions
5. Sample-based review instead of 100%

### Issue: Reviewers Not Receiving Alerts

**Symptoms:** Alerts stuck in queue

**Solutions:**
1. Verify reviewer role assignments
2. Check email notifications configured
3. Verify reviewer mailbox is active
4. Review routing rules
5. Check for Teams notification issues

### Issue: Copilot Conversations Not Captured

**Symptoms:** Agent interactions not appearing

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Copilot location is selected in policy
2. Check licensing for Copilot capture
3. Review audit log for Copilot events
4. Verify agent is integrated with monitored channel
5. Contact Microsoft support for enablement

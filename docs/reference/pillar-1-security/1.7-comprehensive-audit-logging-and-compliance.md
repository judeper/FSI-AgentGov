# Control 1.7: Comprehensive Audit Logging and Compliance

## Overview

**Control ID:** 1.7
**Control Name:** Comprehensive Audit Logging and Compliance
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, SOX 302/404, GLBA 501(b)
**Setup Time:** 1-2 hours (Standard) or 8-10 hours (Azure WORM)

---

### Purpose

Implement comprehensive audit logging to capture Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Studio agent interactions, providing an evidence trail commonly requested for regulatory examinations, security investigations, and compliance monitoring. For broker-dealers, this control includes guidance that may help support SEC 17a-4(f) WORM storage requirements as part of a broader records and supervision program.

!!! info "U.S.-only framing"
    The regulatory references and examples in this control are written for U.S. financial services
    (e.g., FINRA/SEC/SOX/GLBA). If you operate outside the U.S., adapt this guidance to your
    applicable regulatory regime with legal/compliance counsel.

## Financial Sector Considerations

### Regulatory Mapping

| Regulation | Retention Requirement | Control Implementation |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **FINRA 4511** | 6 years for customer records | 6+ year retention policy |
| **SEC 17a-3/4** | 3-6 years depending on record type | Extended retention + WORM |
| **SOX 302/404** | 7 years for audit documentation | 7-year retention minimum |
| **GLBA 501(b)** | Reasonable retention for security logs | 3+ year retention |
| **FFIEC** | Commensurate with risk | Risk-based retention |

### Tier-Specific Audit Configuration

| Tier | Retention | Real-time SIEM | WORM Required | Review Frequency |
|------|-----------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Tier 1 | 180 days (default) | Optional | No | Monthly |
| Tier 2 | 1 year | Recommended | No | Weekly |
| Tier 3 | 6+ years | Strongly recommended (high-risk) | If broker-dealer | Daily |

### Agent Activity Event Types for FSI

| Event Type | Description | FSI Monitoring Priority |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| CopilotInteraction | User-Copilot conversations | High - customer interactions |
| PublishedAgent | Agent made available | Critical - deployment control |
| AgentConfigChanged | Agent settings modified | High - change management |
| ConnectorAdded | Data source connected | Critical - data access |
| SensitiveDataAccessed | Agent accessed sensitive info | Critical - data protection |

### FSI Example: Broker-Dealer Audit Configuration

```yaml
Organization: Registered Broker-Dealer
Regulatory Requirement: SEC 17a-4(f), FINRA 4511

Audit Configuration:
  Standard Retention:
    - Default: 180 days (E3)
    - Extended: 10 years (E5)
    - Custom: 6-year policy for customer records

  WORM Compliance:
    - Method: Azure Immutable Blob Storage
    - Policy: Time-based retention (6 years)
    - Export: Weekly automated export
    - Verification: Monthly integrity check

  SIEM Integration:
    - Platform: Microsoft Sentinel
    - Connector: Office 365 (Unified Audit Log)
    - Real-time: Yes
    - Alerting: Configured for sensitive events

  Monitoring:
        - Daily: Tier 3 agent activity review
    - Weekly: Full audit log health check
    - Monthly: Retention policy verification
    - Annual: SEC examination readiness test
```

---

### Regulatory Context

**Primary Regulations:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, SOX 302/404, GLBA 501(b)

| Regulation | Audit Logging Requirement |
|------------|---------------------------|
| FINRA 4511 | Books and records - retain AI interaction logs |
| SEC 17a-3/4 | Record retention for AI-assisted communications |
| SOX 302/404 | Internal controls over AI system logging |
| GLBA 501(b) | Security safeguards including audit trails |

### Examination Considerations

Regulators may request:

- Audit logs for specific time periods
- Evidence of retention policy configuration
- Export of agent interaction logs
- Demonstration of search capabilities
- Proof of immutable storage (Level 4)

### SEC 17a-4 WORM Requirements (Broker-Dealers)

!!! warning "Important for Broker-Dealers"
    SEC Rule 17a-4(f) requires certain electronic records to be stored in non-rewritable,
    non-erasable format (WORM - Write Once, Read Many). Microsoft 365's native audit log retention
    and export capabilities may not, by themselves, satisfy 17a-4(f) without additional design,
    validation, and oversight.

**Compliance Options:**

| Option | Description | Compliance Status |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Azure Immutable Blob Storage** | Export audit logs to Azure with an immutable (WORM) policy | May support meeting WORM storage requirements when correctly configured and independently validated; consult counsel |
| **Third-party WORM archive** | Use an archival vendor offering WORM retention and supervisory controls | May support meeting WORM storage requirements depending on vendor capabilities/attestations (e.g., no-action context) and your procedures |
| **Microsoft 365 Audit Premium only** | Extended retention without WORM immutability controls | May support longer retention for investigations, but may be insufficient for 17a-4(f) WORM requirements by itself |

**Recommendation:** Broker-dealers should implement a documented export + preservation process (often weekly or more frequent) to immutable storage and perform periodic integrity verification. Where a third-party archive is used, confirm contract terms, retention controls, and applicable attestations/letters with counsel.

See [Azure immutable blob storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/immutable-storage-overview) for implementation details.

---

### Zone-Specific Configuration

**Zone 1 (Personal Productivity):**

- Apply a baseline minimum of audit logging that impacts tenant-wide safety (where applicable), and document any exceptions for personal agents.
- Avoid expanding scope beyond the user’s own data unless explicitly justified.
- Rationale: reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low; legal/compliance can tighten later.

**Zone 2 (Team Collaboration):**

- Apply ensure key agent/admin activities are logged and reviewable for shared agents and shared data sources; require an identified owner and an approval trail.
- Validate configuration in a pilot environment before broader rollout; retain audit configuration + sample queries.
- Rationale: shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied and provable.

**Zone 3 (Enterprise Managed):**

- Require the strictest configuration for audit logging and enforce it via policy where possible (not manual-only).
- Treat changes as controlled (change ticket + documented testing); retain audit configuration + sample queries.
- Rationale: enterprise agents handle the most sensitive content and are the highest audit/regulatory risk.

## Verification & Testing

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to purview.microsoft.com → Audit | Audit dashboard displayed |
| 2 | Access Search page | Search form with all fields visible |
| 3 | Search for Copilot events (last 24 hours) | Results returned (if activity exists) |
| 4 | Check retention policies | Policies configured per governance tier and scoped appropriately |
| 5 | Verify export capability | Export completes successfully |
| 6 | Test SIEM integration | Logs appearing in external system |

### Evidence Pack (U.S.-focused exam readiness)

Capture an evidence pack that demonstrates audit **configuration**, **operation**, **retention**, and **retrieval**. Use this checklist as a starting point; the exact artifacts to retain depend on your policies, regulator expectations, and internal procedures.

- [ ] **Purview Audit access**
    - Screenshot: Purview **Audit → Search** page visible (shows tenant can access Audit).
    - Screenshot/export: operator role assignment evidence (e.g., Entra ID role assignment screen or Purview role group membership).
- [ ] **Audit ingestion enabled**
    - PowerShell transcript excerpt: `Get-AdminAuditLogConfig` showing `UnifiedAuditLogIngestionEnabled`.
- [ ] **Agent/Copilot event retrieval**
    - Screenshot: Audit search parameters (date range in UTC, selected activities/record types) and the resulting record list.
    - Export: CSV export of a small, representative result set (e.g., last 24 hours) including columns such as `CreationDate`, `UserIds`, `Operations`, `RecordType`.
- [ ] **Retention policy configuration**
    - Screenshot: Purview **Audit → Policies** list showing the relevant policy name(s), retention duration, and scope.
    - Change record: ticket/approval reference for retention configuration changes.
- [ ] **Export and preservation (if exporting to external storage)**
    - Export log: evidence of the export run (job output/transcript, filenames, export window start/end).
    - File hash: record a SHA-256 of each exported file and store hashes with the change record.
    - Screenshot: storage container and immutable policy settings (if using immutable storage).
- [ ] **Monitoring and alerting (if applicable)**
    - SIEM proof: screenshot showing the corresponding event(s) ingested (with timestamp alignment and UTC conversion noted).

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>

### Issue: No Audit Events Appearing in Search

**Symptoms:** Audit search returns empty results despite known activity

**Solutions:**

1. Verify unified audit logging is enabled (Set-AdminAuditLogConfig)
2. Confirm you are searching **UTC** time range (the UI uses UTC fields)
3. Check date range and ingestion latency - audit events may take ~30 min to 24 hours to appear
4. Verify you have appropriate permissions (e.g., Compliance Administrator / Purview Audit roles)
5. Try a broad search (no Activities/Workloads filters) to confirm **any** audit data exists
6. If Exchange events are expected, check if mailbox auditing is enabled for mailbox-related events
7. Validate via PowerShell using `Search-UnifiedAuditLog` to rule out a UI-only issue

### Issue: Copilot Events Not Being Logged

**Symptoms:** Other audit events appear but no CopilotInteraction records

**Solutions:**

1. Verify users have Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses assigned
2. Confirm Copilot is actually being used (not just licensed)
3. Search broadly first (no Activities filter), then narrow to `RecordType`/activities such as `CopilotInteraction`
4. Wait longer - Copilot events may have additional latency
5. Verify the activity you expect is part of audited workloads for your tenant (availability can vary by workload and feature rollout)
6. If Copilot Studio agents are the focus, also search for Copilot Studio / Power Platform record types and agent lifecycle events

### Issue: Expected Events Missing (Partial Results)

**Symptoms:** Some audit events appear, but specific expected activities/operations are missing or incomplete

**Solutions:**

1. Remove restrictive filters first (Activities/Workloads/Users/ObjectId) and confirm the time range returns any results
2. Confirm your selected date/time range is in **UTC** and matches when the activity occurred
3. Broaden the search window and repeat (e.g., last 7 days) to account for ingestion latency
4. Validate the same query via PowerShell using `Search-UnifiedAuditLog` to rule out a UI-only issue
5. Check whether the operation name you’re filtering on matches what your tenant emits (friendly names vs operation names can differ)
6. If results are very large, break the search into smaller windows and document export windows to avoid gaps/overlaps

### Issue: Audit Log Export Fails or Incomplete

**Symptoms:** Export times out or contains fewer records than expected

**Solutions:**

1. Reduce date range to smaller chunks
2. Add filters to reduce result set size
3. Use PowerShell instead of portal for large exports
4. Check for rate limiting (wait and retry)
5. Verify network connectivity and session timeout
6. If results exceed portal limits, perform exports in paged intervals and document the export windows to avoid gaps/overlaps

### Issue: Extended Retention Not Working

**Symptoms:** Old audit events are missing despite retention policy

**Solutions:**

1. Verify retention policy is properly configured and enabled
2. Check policy priority if multiple policies exist
3. Confirm users are assigned appropriate E5/E5 Compliance licenses
4. Review policy scope (ensure it covers needed record types)
5. Contact Microsoft Support for retention investigation

**Notes:**

- Extended retention applies to eligible events/record types and requires the right licensing and policy scope.
- Retention policy configuration helps preserve audit records, but you still need operational procedures for export, access control, and integrity verification for regulated use cases.

### Issue: SIEM Integration Missing Events

**Symptoms:** Some audit events not appearing in Sentinel/SIEM

**Solutions:**

1. Verify data connector is properly configured
2. Check for ingestion delays (can be 5-15 minutes)
3. Review connector health in Sentinel
4. Verify record types are included in connector config
5. Check for any data filtering rules that may exclude events
6. Validate end-to-end by correlating a known audit record (timestamp/user/operation) against the SIEM query window and UTC/local time settings

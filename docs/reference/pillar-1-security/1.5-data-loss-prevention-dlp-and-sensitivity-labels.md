# Control 1.5: Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Sensitivity Labels

## Overview

**Control ID:** 1.5
**Control Name:** Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Sensitivity Labels
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC Reg S-P, GLBA 501(b), SOX 404
**Setup Time:** 2-4 hours

---

## Description

Data Loss Prevention policies protect sensitive information from unauthorized exposure through AI agents. When combined with sensitivity labels, DLP provides comprehensive data protection across Microsoft Copilot, Copilot Studio agents, and other AI applications. Integration with DSPM for AI enables oversharing detection and AI-specific policy enforcement.

See [DLP for M365 Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/dlp-microsoft-copilot) for AI-specific DLP capabilities.

## Key Capabilities

| Capability | Description | FSI Relevance |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **AI-aware DLP policies** | Policies targeting AI applications | Prevent sensitive data in AI |
| **Sensitivity label enforcement** | Block/warn based on labels | Classification-based protection |
| **Oversharing assessment** | Identify data exposure risks | Risk identification |
| **DSPM integration** | Unified AI data protection | Comprehensive visibility |

---

## DLP for AI Applications

### AI-Specific DLP Policies

DLP policies can specifically target AI applications:

| Policy Type | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Detect sensitive info added to AI sites** | Monitor sensitive data in AI knowledge sources | Prevent exposure via grounding data |
| **Detect sensitive info shared in AI prompts** | Monitor user prompts for sensitive content | Prevent data leakage in queries |
| **Block sensitive info in agent responses** | Prevent agents from returning sensitive data | Response filtering |

### Configuring AI DLP Policies

1. Open [Microsoft Purview](https://purview.microsoft.com)
2. Navigate to **Data loss prevention → Policies**
3. Create or modify policy
4. Select AI-related locations (M365 Copilot, Copilot Studio)
5. Configure conditions for sensitive information types
6. Set actions (Block, Warn, Audit only)

See [Create DLP policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/dlp-create-deploy-policy) for detailed steps.

---

## DSPM for AI Integration

DLP policies integrate with DSPM for AI for unified management:

### Viewing DLP Policies in DSPM

1. Navigate to **DSPM for AI → Policies**
2. Expand **Data Loss Prevention** section
3. View AI-related DLP policies and status

### Example AI DLP Policies

| Policy Name | Solution | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| DSPM for AI: Detect sensitive info added to AI sites | Data Loss Prevention | Monitor knowledge sources |
| DSPM for AI - Detect sensitive info shared in AI prompts in Edge | DSPM for AI | Browser-based protection |

---

## Oversharing Assessments

### What is Oversharing?

Oversharing occurs when sensitive data is accessible to more users than necessary, creating risk when AI agents access that data as grounding content.

### DSPM Oversharing Detection

DSPM for AI provides oversharing assessments:

1. Navigate to **DSPM for AI → Data risk assessments**
2. Review **Assess and prevent oversharing** section
3. Follow three-step process:
   - **Identify**: Review weekly assessment results
   - **Protect**: Apply labels and retention policies
   - **Monitor**: Conduct access reviews

### Custom Oversharing Assessments

Create targeted assessments for agent knowledge sources:

1. Click **+ Create custom assessment**
2. Select data sources (SharePoint sites used by agents)
3. Define user scope
4. Review overshared items count
5. Remediate excessive permissions

## Sensitivity Labels

### Label-Based Protection for Agents

| Label | Agent Access | Recommendation |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Public** | Full access | Zone 1-3 agents |
| **Internal** | Full access | Zone 1-3 agents |
| **Confidential** | Restricted | Zone 2-3 agents only |
| **Highly Confidential** | Blocked | Block from all agents |

### Configuring Label-Based DLP

1. Create sensitivity labels in Purview
2. Apply labels to content
3. Create DLP policy with label conditions
4. Configure actions:
   - **Highly Confidential**: Block agent access
   - **Confidential**: Warn user, log access
   - **Internal/Public**: Allow access

### Agent Knowledge Source Labels

For SharePoint sites used as agent knowledge sources:

| Content Type | Recommended Label | DLP Action |
|--------------|-------------------|------------|
| Customer PII | Confidential | Warn + Log |
| Financial data | Highly Confidential | Block |
| Internal docs | Internal | Allow |
| Public content | Public | Allow |

---

## Governance Levels

### Level 1 - Baseline

| Requirement | Configuration |
|-------------|---------------|
| Basic DLP | Policies for common sensitive info types |
| Labels defined | Sensitivity label taxonomy created |

- Configure label-based blocking for Highly Confidential
- Quarterly oversharing assessments for agent knowledge sources
- Weekly review of DLP alerts related to AI

### Level 4 - Regulated/High-Risk

| Requirement | Configuration |
|-------------|---------------|
| Comprehensive DLP | All AI touchpoints covered |
| Mandatory labels | Auto-labeling for sensitive content |
| Real-time blocking | Block mode for Zone 3 agents |

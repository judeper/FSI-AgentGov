# Control 4.1: SharePoint Information Access Governance (IAG) / Restricted Content Discovery

## Overview

**Control ID:** 4.1
**Control Name:** SharePoint Information Access Governance (IAG) / Restricted Content Discovery
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), 504(b), SEC Reg S-P, FINRA 4511
**Setup Time:** 1-2 hours
**License Requirement:** SharePoint Advanced Management (PRO)

---

## Purpose

Control which SharePoint sites and content can be accessed by Microsoft 365 Copilot and AI agents. This control prevents agents from discovering and surfacing sensitive content that users may have access to but should not be exposed through AI interactions.

---

## Key Capabilities

### Restrict Content from Microsoft 365 Copilot

Site-level setting that prevents Copilot from accessing site content, even if users have permissions.

**Navigation:** SharePoint Admin Center → Sites → Active sites → Select site → Settings tab

**Options:**
- **On:** Copilot cannot access content from this site
- **Off:** Copilot can access content per user permissions (default)

### Restricted Site Access

Organization-level feature that limits site access to specific security groups.

**Navigation:** SharePoint Admin Center → Sites → Active sites → Select site → Settings tab → Restricted site access → Edit

**Use cases:**
- Restrict sensitive sites to specific security groups
- Prevent broad "Everyone except external users" access
- Control agent access to confidential content

## Governance Levels

### Baseline (Level 1)

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Identify sensitive sites | Audit sites containing regulated content (PII, financial, customer data) |
| Enable content restriction | Toggle "Restrict content from Microsoft 365 Copilot" = On for Zone 3 sites |
| Document restricted sites | Maintain list of sites with Copilot restrictions enabled |

**Implementation Steps:**

1. Navigate to [SharePoint Admin Center](https://admin.sharepoint.com)
2. Go to **Sites** → **Active sites**
3. Select a site containing sensitive content
4. Click **Settings** tab in the right panel
5. Under "Restrict content from Microsoft 365 Copilot" select **On**
6. Document the change in your governance records

### Recommended (Level 2-3)

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Zone-based restriction policy | Enable restrictions for all Zone 3 sites by default |
| Restricted site access | Configure site-level access restrictions for sensitive sites |
| Quarterly access reviews | Review restricted sites list quarterly |
| Oversharing assessment | Run oversharing assessment from Advanced management |

**Additional Steps:**

1. Navigate to **Advanced management** → **Overview**
2. Click **Start assessment** to run Copilot readiness assessment
3. Review "Oversharing" results for sites with broad permissions
4. For flagged sites, enable "Restrict content from Microsoft 365 Copilot"
5. Configure **Restricted site access** for Zone 3 sites requiring group-based access

### Regulated/High-Risk (Level 4)

| Requirement | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Mandatory Zone 3 restriction | All Zone 3 sites must have Copilot content restriction enabled |
| Admin-controlled access lists | Restricted site access with documented security groups |
| Immutable access logs | Audit all changes to restriction settings |
| Policy documentation | Formal policy requiring IAG for regulated content |

**Additional Requirements:**

- Document all restricted sites in agent inventory
- Require governance committee approval to disable restrictions
- Archive configuration screenshots for audit evidence
- Integrate restriction changes with change management process

---

## Verification & Testing

### Test Procedure

1. Navigate to SharePoint Admin Center → Sites → Active sites
2. Select a Zone 3 site and verify Settings panel opens
3. Confirm "Restrict content from Microsoft 365 Copilot" setting is visible
4. Verify setting is **On** for regulated sites
5. Check "Restricted site access" status
6. Test by asking Copilot about content from a restricted site

**Expected Results:**

- [ ] Settings panel shows Copilot restriction toggle
- [ ] Zone 3 sites have restriction set to **On**
- [ ] Copilot does not surface content from restricted sites
- [ ] Audit logs capture setting changes

### Verification Evidence

| Evidence Type | Location | Retention |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Configuration screenshot | Site Settings panel | 1 year |
| Restricted sites list | Governance documentation | 6 years |
| Setting change audit | Unified Audit Log | Per retention policy |

## Implementation Guidance

### Step 1: Inventory Sensitive Sites

Run Data access governance reports to identify sites requiring restriction:

1. Navigate to **Reports** → **Data access governance**
2. View "Site permissions across your organization" report
3. Identify sites with broad permissions (Everyone except external users)
4. Cross-reference with Zone 3 agent knowledge sources

### Step 2: Enable Content Restrictions

For each identified site:

1. Go to **Sites** → **Active sites**
2. Select the site
3. Open **Settings** tab
4. Set "Restrict content from Microsoft 365 Copilot" to **On**
5. If needed, configure "Restricted site access" for group-based access

### Step 3: Document Configuration

Record in your governance system:

- Site URL and name
- Restriction setting enabled date
- Reason for restriction
- Approving authority
- Review schedule

### Step 4: Verify Effectiveness

Test that agents cannot access restricted content:

1. Log in as a user with site access
2. Ask Copilot a question that would require content from the restricted site
3. Verify Copilot does not return content from the restricted site
4. Document test results

### Step 5: Establish Review Cycle

- Quarterly: Review restricted sites list
- On agent deployment: Verify knowledge sources are appropriately restricted
- On regulatory change: Assess new restriction requirements

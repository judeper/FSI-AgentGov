## Key Capabilities

### Data Access Governance Reports

Snapshot reports providing visibility into site permissions and sharing activity.

**Navigation:** SharePoint Admin Center → Reports → Data access governance

**Available Reports:**

| Report | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Site permissions across your organization | Broad permissions (Everyone, guests, sharing links) | Identify oversharing risks |
| Site permissions for users | User-specific site access | Verify individual access |
| Sensitivity labels applied to files | Sensitive content locations | Prioritize review scope |
| Sharing links | New sharing links (last 28 days) | Monitor sharing activity |
| Shared with 'Everyone except external users' | Broadly shared content | Identify oversharing |

### Site Attestation Policies

Automated workflows requiring site owners to certify site information.

**Navigation:** SharePoint Admin Center → Policies → Site lifecycle management → Site attestation policies

**Policy Actions:**

- Identify sites due for attestation
- Send notifications to site owners/admins
- Automatically archive or mark sites as read-only if not attested

## Implementation Guidance

### Step 1: Assess Current Permissions

Generate baseline permissions report:

1. Navigate to **Reports** → **Data access governance**
2. Click **View reports** under "Site permissions across your organization"
3. Export report for analysis
4. Identify sites with:
   - "Everyone except external users" access
   - Guest user access
   - Broad sharing links
5. Prioritize Zone 2+ sites and agent knowledge sources

### Step 2: Configure Attestation Policies

Create attestation policy for regulated sites:

1. Navigate to **Policies** → **Site lifecycle management**
2. Click **Open** under "Site attestation policies"
3. Click **Create policy**
4. Configure scope:
   - By sensitivity label (Confidential, Highly Confidential)
   - By site URL pattern
   - By site template
5. Set frequency: Annual for Zone 3, Quarterly for active agent sites
6. Configure notifications:
   - Reminder before due date
   - Escalation to admin if overdue
7. Set non-compliance action (recommend: read-only)

### Step 3: Establish Review Process

Document access review procedures:

- Who performs reviews (site owners, governance team)
- Review frequency by zone
- Required documentation
- Remediation workflow
- Escalation process

### Step 4: Document Results

For each review cycle:

- Export permissions report
- Record attestation status
- Document remediation actions
- Archive evidence for audit

### Step 5: Monitor Compliance

Track attestation compliance:

- Review attestation completion rates

# Control 4.2: Site Access Reviews and Certification

## Overview

**Control ID:** 4.2  
**Control Name:** Site Access Reviews and Certification  
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), 504(b), 505(b), SOX 404, FINRA 4511  
**Setup Time:** 1-2 hours  
**License Requirement:** SharePoint Advanced Management Plan 1 for full capabilities  

---

### Purpose


Establish periodic reviews of SharePoint site access to ensure only authorized users and agents can access sensitive content. Site attestation policies require site owners to certify that access permissions remain appropriate. In financial services environments, regular access reviews are essential for demonstrating compliance with regulatory requirements around data access controls and maintaining audit evidence of authorization decisions.

---

### Key Capabilities


### Data Access Governance Reports

Snapshot reports providing visibility into site permissions and sharing activity.

**Navigation:** SharePoint Admin Center → Reports → Data access governance

**Available Reports:**

| Report | Description | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Site permissions across your organization | Broad permissions (Everyone, guests, sharing links) | Identify oversharing risks |
| Site permissions for users | User-specific site access | Verify individual access |
| Sensitivity labels applied to files | Sensitive content locations | Prioritize review scope |
| Sharing links | New sharing links (last 28 days) | Monitor sharing activity |
| Shared with 'Everyone except external users' | Broadly shared content | Identify oversharing |

### Site Attestation Policies

Automated workflows requiring site owners to certify site information.

**Navigation:** SharePoint Admin Center → Policies → Site lifecycle management → Site attestation policies

**Policy Actions:**

- Identify sites due for attestation
- Send notifications to site owners/admins
- Automatically archive or mark sites as read-only if not attested

## Financial Sector Considerations

### Regulatory Mapping

| Regulation | Requirement | How This Control Addresses | Evidence Required |
|------------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| FINRA 4511 | Supervision and retention of records | Reviews ensure only authorized personnel access records; attestation provides supervision evidence | Attestation records, review completion reports |
| SEC Reg S-P | Safeguards for customer information | Periodic access reviews validate appropriate access controls | Access review decisions, remediation records |
| GLBA 501(b) | Administrative safeguards | Site access reviews demonstrate access control management | Review schedules, completion rates, exceptions |
| SOX 404 | Internal control assessment | Attestation provides evidence of control operating effectiveness | Signed attestations, exception reports |
| NYDFS 500.07 | Access privilege limitations | Reviews ensure access is limited to those with business need | Access review decisions with justifications |

### Governance Tier Review Frequency

| Tier | Classification | Review Frequency | Reviewer | Auto-Remediation |
|------|---------------|------------------|----------|------------------|
| Tier 1 | Public/General | Annual | Site Owner | Archive if not attested |
| Tier 2 | Internal/Sensitive | Semi-Annual | Site Owner + Manager | Read-only if not attested |
| Tier 3 | Confidential/Regulated | Quarterly | Owner + Compliance + Legal | Immediate escalation |

### Regulatory Context


**Primary Regulations:** GLBA 501(b), SOX 404, FINRA 4511

| Regulation | Requirement | How This Control Addresses |
|------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| GLBA 501(b) | Access control to NPI | Reviews ensure appropriate access |
| SOX 404 | Internal controls assessment | Attestation provides control evidence |
| FINRA 4511 | Supervision of records | Reviews ensure proper access governance |

---


### Zone-Specific Configuration


**Zone 1 (Personal Productivity):**

- Apply a baseline minimum of SharePoint access reviews and certification that impacts tenant-wide safety (where applicable), and document any exceptions for personal agents.
- Avoid expanding scope beyond the user’s own data unless explicitly justified.
- Rationale: reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low; legal/compliance can tighten later.

**Zone 2 (Team Collaboration):**

- Apply run periodic access reviews/attestations for agent knowledge sites for shared agents and shared data sources; require an identified owner and an approval trail.
- Validate configuration in a pilot environment before broader rollout; retain review exports/attestation records.
- Rationale: shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied and provable.

**Zone 3 (Enterprise Managed):**

- Require the strictest configuration for SharePoint access reviews and certification and enforce it via policy where possible (not manual-only).
- Treat changes as controlled (change ticket + documented testing); retain review exports/attestation records.
- Rationale: enterprise agents handle the most sensitive content and are the highest audit/regulatory risk.

### AI Agent Service Account Access Reviews

**Purpose:** AI agents may use service accounts or service principals to access SharePoint content. These accounts require special attention in access reviews to ensure least privilege principles are maintained.

**Service Account Types for AI Agents:**

| Account Type | Description | Review Consideration |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Service Principal** | App registration for agent | Review API permissions |
| **Managed Identity** | Azure-managed identity | Review resource access |
| **Dedicated User Account** | User account for agent | Review site permissions |
| **Maker's Account** | Agent uses maker credentials | High-risk configuration |

**Least Privilege Checklist for AI Agent Accounts:**

```markdown
# AI Agent Service Account Access Review

## Account Information
- **Account Name/ID:** [Name]
- **Account Type:** [ ] Service Principal [ ] Managed Identity [ ] User Account
- **Associated Agent(s):** [Agent names]
- **Review Date:** [Date]
- **Reviewer:** [Name]

## Permission Assessment

### SharePoint Site Access
| Site | Permission Level | Business Justification | Least Privilege? |
|------|-----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| [Site 1] | [Read/Contribute/Full] | [Justification] | [ ] Yes [ ] No |

### API Permissions (Service Principals)
| Permission | Type | Justification | Required? |
|------------|------|---------------|-----------|
| Sites.Read.All | Application | Read all sites | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| Sites.Selected | Application | Read specific sites | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| Files.Read.All | Application | Read all files | [ ] Yes [ ] No |

## Least Privilege Validation
- [ ] Account has minimum permissions needed for agent function
- [ ] No "Full Control" unless explicitly required and documented
- [ ] No tenant-wide permissions when site-specific would suffice
- [ ] Sites.Selected preferred over Sites.Read.All where possible
- [ ] Permissions align with agent's documented knowledge sources
- [ ] No orphaned permissions (from retired agents)

## Findings
- **Excessive Permissions Found:** [ ] Yes [ ] No
- **Details:** [Description]
- **Remediation Required:** [ ] Yes [ ] No

## Remediation Actions
| Action | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| [Action 1] | [Name] | [Date] | [Status] |

## Sign-off
- **Reviewer:** _______ Date: _____
- **AI Governance Lead:** _______ Date: _____
```

**PowerShell: Audit Service Principal Permissions**

```powershell

            Write-Host "    Consider using Sites.Selected for specific site access" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        }
    }

    if ($hasSelected) {
        Write-Host "  GOOD: Using Sites.Selected (least privilege pattern)" -ForegroundColor Green
    }
}

# Usage:
# Get-AgentServicePrincipalPermissions -AppId "your-app-id-here"
```

**Integrating Agent Accounts into Access Reviews:**

1. **Inventory agent service accounts** as part of [Control 3.1: Agent Inventory](../pillar-3-reporting/3.1-agent-inventory-and-metadata-management.md)
2. **Include in access review schedule** with dedicated review line for service accounts
3. **Document business justification** for each permission
4. **Review quarterly** for Zone 3 agents, semi-annually for Zone 2
5. **Alert on permission changes** via audit log monitoring

## Verification & Testing

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>


### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Data access governance reports not available | SharePoint Advanced Management not licensed | Verify SharePoint Advanced Management Plan 1 license is assigned; navigate to M365 Admin Center > Billing to confirm |
| Site attestation policy not sending notifications | Email settings misconfigured or owners not defined | Verify site owners are assigned; check notification settings in policy; review mail flow rules |
| Access review not starting automatically | Recurrence pattern misconfigured | Verify recurrence settings in review definition; check that start date is not in the past |
| Decisions not being auto-applied | Auto-apply disabled or permissions insufficient | Enable autoApplyDecisionsEnabled in review settings; verify service principal has appropriate permissions |
| Export fails with permission error | Insufficient Graph API permissions | Ensure AccessReview.ReadWrite.All scope is consented; reconnect with appropriate scopes |
| Site owners not receiving attestation requests | Owner property not set on site | Use Get-SPOSite to verify owner; use Set-SPOSite -Owner to assign appropriate owner |
| Compliance reports showing stale data | Snapshot not recently generated | Navigate to Data access governance and click "Get started" to generate fresh snapshot |

### Diagnostic Commands

```powershell
# Check access review health
Get-MgIdentityGovernanceAccessReviewDefinition |

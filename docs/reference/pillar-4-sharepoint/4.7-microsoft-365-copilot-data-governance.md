# Control 4.7: Microsoft 365 Copilot Data Governance

## Overview

**Control ID:** 4.7
**Control Name:** Microsoft 365 Copilot Data Governance
**Regulatory Reference:** SEC 17a-3/4, GLBA 501(b), FINRA 4511, SOX 302/404, OCC 2011-12
**Setup Time:** 5-7 hours

---

### Purpose

Establish governance controls specific to **Microsoft 365 Copilot** (the embedded AI capabilities in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, and other M365 applications) as distinct from custom agents built in Copilot Studio. This control addresses knowledge source governance, plugin management, user behavior guardrails, and output quality considerations for the M365 Copilot experiences that access organizational data through the Microsoft Graph and Semantic Index.

!!! info "M365 Copilot vs. Copilot Studio"
    This control focuses on the **embedded Copilot experiences** (Copilot in Word, Excel, Teams, etc.) that are available to users with Microsoft 365 Copilot licenses. For custom agent governance, see [Control 4.6 (Grounding Scope Governance)](4.6-grounding-scope-governance.md) and Pillar 2 Management controls. The two require different governance approaches because M365 Copilot accesses broader organizational data automatically, while Copilot Studio agents have explicitly configured knowledge sources.

---

### Description

Microsoft 365 Copilot Data Governance establishes policies and procedures for:

- **Knowledge Source Boundaries:** Control which SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams data M365 Copilot can access
- **Web and Plugin Access:** Manage external data sources and third-party plugins
- **User Behavior Guardrails:** Policies for appropriate use and over-reliance prevention
- **Output Quality Assurance:** Review processes for Copilot-generated content
- **Access Control:** Ensure Copilot respects existing permissions and doesn't surface overshared content

See [Microsoft 365 Copilot overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-copilot/microsoft-365-copilot-overview) for platform details.

## Setup & Configuration

### Step 1: Understand M365 Copilot Data Access

**What M365 Copilot Can Access:**

Microsoft 365 Copilot accesses data through the Microsoft Graph, respecting user permissions:

| Data Source | Default Access | Governance Control |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **User's OneDrive** | Yes (user's own files) | N/A - personal scope |
| **SharePoint Sites** | Yes (if user has access) | Restricted Content Discovery |
| **Teams Channels** | Yes (if user is member) | Teams governance policies |
| **Outlook Email** | Yes (user's mailbox) | Exchange policies |
| **Microsoft Graph** | Per user permissions | App permissions |
| **Web Search** | Configurable | Admin setting |
| **Plugins** | Configurable | Admin approval |

**Permission Model:**

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

                    Discovery (RCD) can
                    exclude sites from
                    Copilot results
```

### Step 2: Configure Copilot Settings in M365 Admin Center

**Portal Path:** Microsoft 365 Admin Center → Settings → Copilot

1. Navigate to **admin.microsoft.com**
2. Go to **Settings** → **Org settings** → **Copilot**
3. Configure the following:

**Copilot General Settings:**

| Setting | Baseline | Recommended | Regulated |
|---------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Copilot enabled** | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Web search** | Enabled | Review | Disabled |
| **Plugin marketplace** | Enabled | Limited | Disabled |
| **Usage analytics** | Enabled | Enabled | Enabled |

**Web Search Configuration:**

```powershell
# Configure web search for M365 Copilot
# Note: Uses Microsoft 365 admin PowerShell

Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Organization.ReadWrite.All"

# Disable web search for Copilot (regulated environments)
$params = @{
    WebSearchEnabled = $false
}

# Get current organization settings
$orgSettings = Get-MgOrganization
Write-Host "Current Copilot web search status requires M365 Admin Center configuration"
```

### Step 3: Configure Content Exclusions (Restricted Content Discovery)

**Exclude Sensitive Sites from M365 Copilot:**

Per [Control 4.6](4.6-grounding-scope-governance.md) and [Control 4.1](4.1-sharepoint-information-access-governance-iag-restricted-content-discovery.md):

**Portal Path:** SharePoint Admin Center → Sites → Active sites → [Site] → Settings

```powershell
# Exclude site from M365 Copilot via Restricted Content Discovery
Connect-SPOService -Url "https://tenant-admin.sharepoint.com"

# Exclude sensitive sites from Copilot (and org-wide search)
$sensitiveSites = @(
    "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/ExecutiveCompensation",
    "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/MergerTarget",
    "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/LegalHold",
    "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/ComplianceInvestigations"
)

foreach ($siteUrl in $sensitiveSites) {
    Set-SPOSite -Identity $siteUrl -RestrictContentOrgWideSearchAndCopilot $true
    Write-Host "Excluded from Copilot: $siteUrl" -ForegroundColor Yellow
}

# Verify exclusions
foreach ($siteUrl in $sensitiveSites) {
    $site = Get-SPOSite -Identity $siteUrl
    Write-Host "$siteUrl - RCD Enabled: $($site.RestrictContentOrgWideSearchAndCopilot)"
}
```

**Categories to Consider for Exclusion:**

| Content Category | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Executive compensation** | High | Exclude |
| **M&A / Deal rooms** | Critical | Exclude |
| **Legal/Compliance investigations** | Critical | Exclude |
| **HR confidential** | High | Exclude |
| **Board materials** | High | Exclude |
| **Draft content** | Medium | Consider exclusion |
| **Personal OneDrive** | Low | User-controlled |
| **General knowledge bases** | Low | Include |

### Step 4: Configure Plugin Governance

**Portal Path:** Microsoft 365 Admin Center → Settings → Integrated apps

**Plugin Risk Assessment Framework:**

| Risk Factor | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Data access** | Read-only, public data | Read org data | Read/write sensitive data |
| **Vendor** | Microsoft first-party | Established vendor | Unknown/new vendor |
| **Certification** | M365 certified | SOC 2 | No certification |
| **Data residency** | Same region | Multi-region | Unknown |

**Plugin Approval Workflow:**

```yaml
# Plugin approval workflow configuration
plugin_governance:
  approval_required: true

  approval_workflow:
    requestor_submits:
      - plugin_name
      - business_justification

      - "Custom plugins"

    blocked:
      - "Uncertified plugins"
      - "Plugins without privacy policy"
      - "Plugins storing data outside approved regions"

  review_criteria:
    - "Does the plugin access sensitive data categories?"
    - "Is the vendor SOC 2 certified?"
    - "Where is data processed and stored?"
    - "What audit logging does the plugin provide?"
    - "Is there a data processing agreement in place?"
```

**PowerShell: Review Installed Plugins**

```powershell
# List integrated apps and plugins
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Application.Read.All", "Organization.Read.All"

# Get all service principals (includes integrated apps)
$apps = Get-MgServicePrincipal -Filter "tags/any(t:t eq 'WindowsAzureActiveDirectoryIntegratedApp')" -All

$appInventory = $apps | ForEach-Object {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        DisplayName = $_.DisplayName
        AppId = $_.AppId
        Publisher = $_.PublisherName
        SignInAudience = $_.SignInAudience
        Tags = ($_.Tags -join ", ")
        CreatedDate = $_.CreatedDateTime
    }
}

$appInventory | Export-Csv -Path "M365-Integrated-Apps.csv" -NoTypeInformation
Write-Host "Exported $($appInventory.Count) integrated apps"
```

### Step 5: Establish User Behavior Guardrails

### Step 7: Configure Usage Monitoring

**Portal Path:** Microsoft 365 Admin Center → Reports → Usage → Microsoft 365 Copilot usage

**Key Metrics to Track:**

| Metric | Purpose | Review Frequency |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Active users** | Adoption tracking | Weekly |
| **Feature usage** | Understand patterns | Monthly |
| **Queries per user** | Identify heavy users | Monthly |
| **App distribution** | Which apps used most | Monthly |
| **Feedback submitted** | Quality signal | Weekly |

**PowerShell: Usage Analytics**

```powershell
# Get Copilot usage report
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "Reports.Read.All"

# Get Copilot usage data
$reportPeriod = "D30"  # Last 30 days

# Note: Specific report endpoints depend on available Graph APIs
# Check Microsoft Learn for current Copilot reporting APIs

Write-Host "Copilot usage reports available in M365 Admin Center" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Navigate to: admin.microsoft.com > Reports > Usage > Microsoft 365 Copilot usage"
```

**Copilot Usage Dashboard (Power BI):**

```kql
// Copilot usage summary by application
CopilotInteraction
| where TimeGenerated > ago(30d)
| summarize
    TotalInteractions = count(),
    UniqueUsers = dcount(UserId),
    AvgInteractionsPerUser = round(1.0 * count() / dcount(UserId), 2)
    by ApplicationName
| order by TotalInteractions desc
```

### Step 8: Graph Connector ACL Mapping Validation

**Purpose:** When using Microsoft Graph Connectors to ingest external data into the Semantic Index (making it available to Copilot), it's critical to validate that Access Control Lists (ACLs) from external systems are correctly mapped to Entra ID identities. Incorrect ACL mapping can result in Copilot exposing data to unauthorized users.

!!! warning "Critical for External Data Sources"
    Graph Connectors can index content from external systems (databases, file shares, line-of-business applications). If ACL mapping is incorrect, Copilot may surface content to users who shouldn't have access in the source system.

#### Graph Connector Security Model

**Security Trimming Options:**

| Trimming Type | Description | FSI Recommendation |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Crawl-time (Static)** | ACLs captured during indexing | Faster queries; use for stable permissions |
| **Query-time (Dynamic)** | ACLs checked at search time | More accurate; use for frequently changing permissions |
| **Hybrid** | Crawl-time with periodic refresh | Balance of performance and accuracy |

**Recommendation for FSI:** Use query-time security trimming for data with sensitive or frequently changing permissions. Use crawl-time only for static, well-understood data.

#### ACL Mapping Validation Procedures

**Pre-Ingestion Validation:**

Before enabling a Graph Connector for Copilot access:

```markdown
# Graph Connector Pre-Ingestion Checklist

## Connector Information
- **Connector Name:** [Name]
- **Data Source:** [External system name]
- **Data Classification:** [Confidential/Internal/Public]
- **Estimated Items:** [Count]

## ACL Mapping Design
- **Source Identity Type:** [AD groups, custom IDs, email addresses]
- **Target Identity Type:** [Entra ID users, groups, service principals]
- **Mapping Method:** [Direct lookup, group sync, custom mapping]

## Validation Requirements
- [ ] Identity mapping documented
- [ ] Test user matrix defined
- [ ] Positive and negative test cases identified
- [ ] Crawl-time vs. query-time decision documented

## Sign-Off
Connector Owner: _________________ Date: _________
Security Review: _________________ Date: _________
```

**Identity Mapping Validation:**

For each external identity system connected via Graph Connectors:

| External Identity | Entra ID Mapping | Validation Method |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| AD Group: `FinanceTeam` | Entra Group: `Finance-Users` | Membership comparison |
| AD User: `jsmith@domain.local` | Entra User: `john.smith@company.com` | Direct lookup |
| Custom ID: `DEPT_001` | Entra Group: `Department-001` | Custom mapping table |
| Service Account: `svc_app` | N/A (No user access) | Verify excluded |

**Validation Test Matrix:**

Create a test matrix covering positive and negative access scenarios:

```markdown
# ACL Mapping Test Matrix

## Connector: [Name]
## Test Date: [Date]
## Tester: [Name]

### Positive Tests (Should Access)
| Test ID | User | External Access | Expected Copilot Access | Result |
|---------|------|-----------------|------------------------|--------|
| POS-001 | User A | Has access to Doc X in source | Copilot returns Doc X | [PASS/FAIL] |
| POS-002 | User B | Member of Group Y | Copilot returns Group Y content | [PASS/FAIL] |

### Negative Tests (Should NOT Access)
| Test ID | User | External Access | Expected Copilot Access | Result |
|---------|------|-----------------|------------------------|--------|
| NEG-001 | User C | NO access to Doc X | Copilot does NOT return Doc X | [PASS/FAIL] |
| NEG-002 | User D | Not in Group Y | Copilot does NOT return Group Y content | [PASS/FAIL] |

### Edge Cases
| Test ID | Scenario | Expected Behavior | Result |
|---------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| EDGE-001 | User removed from source group | Access removed in Copilot within [time] | [PASS/FAIL] |
| EDGE-002 | New user added to source | Access granted in Copilot within [time] | [PASS/FAIL] |
| EDGE-003 | Orphaned content (no ACL) | Not accessible OR follows default policy | [PASS/FAIL] |
```

#### Crawl Log Audit Process

**Regular Crawl Log Review:**

Monitor Graph Connector crawl logs for ACL-related issues:

| Check | Frequency | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Crawl completion** | After each crawl | Verify success |
| **ACL mapping errors** | After each crawl | Investigate and resolve |
| **Permission change sync** | Weekly | Verify updates reflected |
| **Orphaned items** | Monthly | Review and remediate |

**Crawl Log Review Query:**

```powershell
# Review Graph Connector crawl logs via Graph API
Connect-MgGraph -Scopes "ExternalConnection.Read.All"

# Get external connections (Graph Connectors)
$connections = Get-MgExternalConnection

foreach ($conn in $connections) {
    Write-Host "`nConnection: $($conn.Name)" -ForegroundColor Cyan

    # Get connection status
    $status = Get-MgExternalConnectionOperation -ExternalConnectionId $conn.Id -All |
        Sort-Object -Property StartedDateTime -Descending |
        Select-Object -First 5

    foreach ($op in $status) {
        $statusColor = switch ($op.Status) {
            "completed" { "Green" }
            "inProgress" { "Yellow" }
            "failed" { "Red" }
            default { "White" }
        }
        Write-Host "  $($op.StartedDateTime): $($op.Status) - $($op.Type)" -ForegroundColor $statusColor
    }
}
```

#### External Data Source Permission Reconciliation

### Step 9: Semantic Index Governance

**Purpose:** The Microsoft 365 Semantic Index powers Copilot's understanding of organizational content by creating semantic representations of documents, emails, and other data. This step establishes governance controls over what content is included in or excluded from the semantic index, and how index changes are monitored.

!!! info "What is the Semantic Index?"
    The Semantic Index is a sophisticated representation layer that enables M365 Copilot to understand the meaning and relationships between content across your organization. It goes beyond keyword search to enable semantic understanding. Control over what enters this index is critical for data governance.

#### Semantic Index Scope Controls

**Default Behavior:**

By default, the Semantic Index includes content that users can access through Microsoft Graph. However, organizations can control scope through:

| Control Method | Scope | Effect on Semantic Index |
|---------------|-------|-------------------------|
| **Restricted Content Discovery (RCD)** | Site-level | Excluded from index and Copilot |
| **Sensitivity Labels** | Document-level | Can exclude from certain AI features |
| **SharePoint Site Classification** | Site-level | Can trigger exclusion policies |
| **Information Barriers** | User/group | Segment access within index |

#### Content Inclusion/Exclusion Matrix

Define what content should or should not be indexed:

| Content Category | Index Status | Governance Rationale |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **General knowledge bases** | Included | Enable productivity |
| **Published policies** | Included | Organizational knowledge |
| **Customer-facing content** | Included with monitoring | Support customer interactions |
| **Executive communications** | Excluded | Confidentiality |
| **M&A / Deal rooms** | Excluded | Material non-public information |
| **Legal hold content** | Excluded | Litigation protection |
| **HR confidential** | Excluded | Privacy |
| **Draft documents** | Evaluate | May contain incomplete/inaccurate info |
| **Historical archives** | Excluded | May contain outdated information |

#### Semantic Index Scope Configuration

**1. Site-Level Exclusion via RCD:**

Per [Control 4.1](4.1-sharepoint-information-access-governance-iag-restricted-content-discovery.md), use RCD to exclude sites from the semantic index:

```powershell
# Exclude site from Semantic Index (and Copilot)
Set-SPOSite -Identity "https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/Confidential" `
    -RestrictContentOrgWideSearchAndCopilot $true
```

**2. Content Classification Policy:**

Create a content classification policy that defines semantic index inclusion:

```yaml
# Semantic Index Content Classification Policy
semantic_index_policy:
  organization: "[Organization Name]"
  effective_date: "2026-01-01"
  version: "1.0"

  default_behavior: "include"  # Include by default unless excluded

  exclusion_rules:
    by_site_classification:
      - classification: "HBI"  # High Business Impact
        action: "exclude"
      - classification: "Confidential"
        action: "exclude"
      - classification: "Restricted"
        action: "exclude"

    by_sensitivity_label:
      - label: "Highly Confidential"
        action: "exclude"

#### Semantic Index Monitoring

**Monitor Index Health and Coverage:**

| Metric | Source | Frequency | Alert Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Index coverage | M365 Admin Reports | Weekly | < 80% expected |
| Exclusion enforcement | SharePoint Admin | Daily | Any failures |
| New content indexed | Audit logs | Real-time | Unexpected patterns |
| Index refresh status | M365 Admin | Daily | Stale > 24 hours |

**Audit Query for Semantic Index Activity:**

```kql
// Monitor for content that may have been unexpectedly indexed
AuditLogs
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| where OperationName contains "Semantic" or OperationName contains "Index"
| project TimeGenerated, UserId, OperationName, TargetResource, Result
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

#### Semantic Index Re-Indexing Procedures

When sensitivity classifications change, content may need to be re-indexed or removed from the index:

**Scenario 1: Content Newly Classified as Confidential**

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Apply sensitivity label or RCD | Immediate |
| 2 | Verify exclusion policy triggers | Same day |
| 3 | Monitor audit logs for compliance | Within 24 hours |
| 4 | Validate content no longer surfaces in Copilot | Within 48 hours |

**Scenario 2: Site Classification Changed to Restricted**

| Step | Action | Timeline |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Enable RCD on site | Immediate |
| 2 | Document change in governance log | Same day |
| 3 | Verify index exclusion | Within 24 hours |
| 4 | Test with authorized user | Within 48 hours |
| 5 | Test with unauthorized user (negative test) | Within 48 hours |

## Financial Sector Considerations

### Regulatory Alignment

| Regulation | Requirement | How This Control Helps |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **SEC 17a-3/4** | Record keeping for AI-assisted communications | Usage logging and retention |
| **GLBA 501(b)** | Information safeguards | Content exclusions and access controls |
| **FINRA 4511** | Books and records | Audit trail of Copilot usage |
| **SOX 302/404** | Internal controls | Output review processes |
| **OCC 2011-12** | Model risk management | Over-reliance prevention |
| **FINRA 3110** | Supervision | Review requirements for outputs |

### Zone-Specific Configuration

**Zone 1 (Personal Productivity):**

- Standard M365 Copilot access for individual productivity
- Self-review of outputs
- Basic acceptable use guidance
- Rationale: Personal productivity use is lower risk

**Zone 2 (Team Collaboration):**

- Configure RCD for sensitive team sites
- Peer review for shared outputs
- Plugin approval for team-specific integrations
- Monthly usage review
- Rationale: Shared outputs require more oversight

**Zone 3 (Enterprise Managed):**

- Comprehensive content exclusions
- Strict plugin allowlist
- Mandatory review for external communications
- Full audit logging
- Quarterly compliance attestation
- Rationale: Enterprise-wide Copilot use requires strictest governance

### M365 Copilot vs. Copilot Studio Comparison

| Aspect | M365 Copilot | Copilot Studio Agents |
|--------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Data access** | User's accessible Graph data | Explicitly configured sources |
| **Scope** | All M365 apps (Word, Excel, etc.) | Custom agent scenarios |
| **Control granularity** | Tenant/site level | Per-agent configuration |
| **Plugin management** | Admin Center | Per-agent connectors |
| **Primary control** | This control (4.7) | Controls 2.x, 4.6 |
| **User interaction** | Embedded in M365 apps | Custom chat interfaces |

### FSI Configuration Example

```yaml
# FSI M365 Copilot Governance Configuration

## Verification & Testing

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Access M365 Copilot in Word/Excel | Copilot functional for licensed user |
| 2 | Query for excluded site content | Content not returned |
| 3 | Attempt to use blocked plugin | Plugin not available |
| 4 | Review usage analytics | Data visible in Admin Center |
| 5 | Verify sensitivity labels honored | Labeled content appropriately restricted |
| 6 | Test audit logging | Copilot interactions logged |

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>

### Issue: Copilot Returning Content from Excluded Site

**Symptoms:** User sees content from site with RCD enabled

**Resolution:**

1. Verify RCD setting on the site (Get-SPOSite)
2. Allow 24 hours for index propagation
3. Check if content exists in multiple locations
4. Verify user doesn't have direct access bypassing RCD
5. Contact Microsoft support if persistent

### Issue: Plugin Not Available After Approval

**Symptoms:** Approved plugin not appearing for users

**Resolution:**

1. Verify plugin is enabled in Admin Center
2. Check user has required license
3. Verify plugin assignment (all users vs. specific groups)
4. Clear browser cache and retry
5. Check for conditional access policies blocking plugin

### Issue: Usage Analytics Not Showing Data

**Symptoms:** Copilot usage reports empty or incomplete

**Resolution:**

1. Verify users have M365 Copilot licenses
2. Allow 48-72 hours for data population
3. Check reporting permissions for admin account
4. Verify no data export restrictions
5. Review Microsoft 365 service health

### Issue: Sensitivity Labels Not Respected

**Symptoms:** Copilot surfaces content despite sensitivity labels

**Resolution:**

1. Verify label includes Copilot restrictions
2. Check label policy assignment to users
3. Verify label is applied to content (not just site)
4. Review DLP policy enforcement
5. Contact Purview support if needed

# Control 2.12: Supervision and Oversight (FINRA Rule 3110)

## Overview

**Control ID:** 2.12
**Control Name:** Supervision and Oversight (FINRA Rule 3110)
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA Rule 3110, FINRA Rule 4511, SEC 17a-4, SOX 302/404
**Setup Time:** 2-3 hours initial setup, ongoing supervision

### Purpose


This control establishes supervisory procedures for AI agents in broker-dealer and financial services operations, directly aligned with FINRA Rule 3110's supervision requirements. FINRA Rule 3110 requires member firms to establish and maintain written supervisory procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable laws and regulations. When AI agents are deployed for customer-facing or business-critical functions, the firm must designate qualified supervisory personnel, implement appropriate oversight mechanisms, and maintain supervision records. This control defines the supervisory structure, review procedures, and documentation requirements for AI agent oversight.

```

### Step 2: Document Written Supervisory Procedures (WSP)

Create WSP section for AI Agent governance per FINRA 3110.

**AI Agent WSP Template:**

```
WRITTEN SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
Section: AI Agent Governance

1. PURPOSE
This section establishes supervisory procedures for the use of AI agents
(including Copilot Studio agents) in firm operations, consistent
with FINRA Rule 3110.

2. SCOPE
These procedures apply to all AI agents that:

- Interact with customers
- Access customer or firm data
- Provide recommendations or advice
- Execute transactions or processes
- Generate communications

3. SUPERVISORY PERSONNEL DESIGNATION
3.1 Chief Compliance Officer: [Name] - Ultimate oversight
3.2 AI Governance Lead: [Name] - Program management
3.3 Designated Supervisors by Function:
    - Customer Service Agents: [Name]
    - Investment Agents: [Name]
    - Operations Agents: [Name]

4. PRE-DEPLOYMENT REVIEW
4.1 All enterprise-managed agents require CCO approval before production
4.2 Review must include:
    - Compliance with applicable regulations
    - Accuracy of information provided
    - Appropriate disclosures
    - Escalation paths to human personnel
    - Data protection measures

5. ONGOING SUPERVISION
5.1 Daily: Automated monitoring of error rates and escalations
5.2 Weekly: Designated supervisor review of sample interactions
5.3 Monthly: AI Governance Lead performance review
5.4 Quarterly: CCO program review

6. SAMPLE REVIEW REQUIREMENTS
6.1 Enterprise-managed agents: Review [X]% of interactions weekly
6.2 Team collaboration agents: Review [X]% of interactions monthly
6.3 Document findings in supervision log

7. ESCALATION PROCEDURES
7.1 Customer complaints regarding AI: Immediate supervisor notification
7.2 Regulatory inquiries: Escalate to CCO within 24 hours
7.3 Material errors or failures: Immediate suspension and review

8. RECORD KEEPING
8.1 Maintain all supervision records for minimum 6 years
8.2 Records include: approvals, reviews, findings, actions taken

9. ANNUAL REVIEW
9.1 WSP for AI agents reviewed annually by CCO
9.2 Updates documented and communicated to supervisory personnel
```

### Step 3: Create Agent Approval Workflow

Build Power Automate workflow for supervisory approval.

**Copilot Studio Agent Approval Flow:**

1. Navigate to **make.powerautomate.com**
2. Create **Automated cloud flow**
3. Trigger: When agent status changes to "Ready for Review"
4. Flow steps:

**Enterprise Managed Agents:**
```
1. Get agent details from registry
2. Send approval to Designated Supervisor
   - Include: Agent summary, test results, risk assessment
3. If approved: Send to AI Governance Lead
4. If approved: Send to CCO (Chief Compliance Officer)
5. Require all three approvals
6. If all approved: Update status to "Approved for Production"
7. Log approval chain with timestamps
```

**Team Collaboration Agents:**
```
1. Get agent details from registry
2. Send approval to Team Lead
3. Send approval to AI Governance Lead
4. Require both approvals
5. Update status and log approvals
```

### Step 4: Configure Supervision Dashboard

Build Power BI dashboard for supervisory oversight.

**Supervision Dashboard Components:**

| Section | Content | Refresh |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Agent Overview** | Total agents by governance tier, status, owner | Daily |
| **Interaction Summary** | Volume, resolution rate, escalations | Real-time |
| **Error Monitoring** | Error count, rate, trending | Real-time |
| **Sample Review Status** | Reviews completed vs. required | Weekly |
| **Approval Pipeline** | Pending approvals, aging | Daily |
| **Compliance Issues** | Open issues, remediation status | Daily |
| **Supervision Log** | Recent supervision activities | Real-time |

### Step 5: Implement Sample Review Process

Define and automate interaction sampling for review.

**Sample Selection Criteria:**

| Trigger | Selection Logic | Priority |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| **Random** | X% of all interactions | Standard |
| **Keyword** | Contains sensitive terms | High |
| **Escalation** | Required human handoff | High |
| **Low CSAT** | Customer rating < 3 | High |
| **New Topic** | First occurrence of topic | Medium |
| **Error** | Agent error detected | High |

**Create SharePoint List: Supervision Review Log**

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Review ID | Auto-number | Unique identifier |
| Agent ID | Lookup | Link to agent registry |
| Session ID | Text | Specific interaction |
| Review Date | Date | When review conducted |
| Reviewer | Person | Designated supervisor |
| Selection Reason | Choice | Random, Keyword, Escalation, etc. |
| Interaction Summary | Multi-line text | Brief description |
| Accuracy | Choice | Accurate, Minor issues, Inaccurate |
| Compliance | Choice | Compliant, Concern, Violation |
| Customer Impact | Choice | Positive, Neutral, Negative |
| Follow-up Required | Yes/No | Needs further action |
| Follow-up Action | Multi-line text | Description of action |
| Resolution | Choice | Closed, Pending, Escalated |

### Step 6: Establish Escalation Procedures

Define clear escalation paths for supervision issues.

<a id="escalation-matrix"></a>

**Escalation Matrix:**

| Issue Type | Initial Contact | Escalation 1 | Escalation 2 | Timeline |
|------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Customer complaint about AI | Agent Owner | AI Governance Lead | CCO | 24 hours |
| Incorrect information provided | Designated Supervisor | AI Governance Lead | CCO | 48 hours |
| Regulatory concern identified | AI Governance Lead | CCO | Legal | Immediate |
| Material agent failure | IT Operations | AI Governance Lead | CCO | 4 hours |
| Data breach/exposure | Security Team | CCO + CISO | Executive Team | Immediate |
| Bias/discrimination concern | AI Governance Lead | CCO + Legal | Executive Team | 24 hours |

### Step 7: Configure Automated Supervision Alerts

**Power Automate Alert Flow:**

1. Create scheduled flow (every 4 hours)
2. Check for:
   - Agents without review in > 7 days
   - Error rates exceeding threshold
   - Pending approvals > 48 hours old
   - Unresolved escalations
3. Send consolidated alert to supervisory personnel

### Step 8: Document Supervision Records

Ensure all supervision activities are logged for FINRA 4511 compliance.

**Required Supervision Records:**

- Agent approval documentation
- Sample review logs
- Supervisory meeting minutes
- Issue identification and resolution
- Training completion records
- Annual WSP review documentation
- Examination response records

**Retention Requirements:**

- FINRA 4511: Minimum 6 years
- SEC 17a-4: 6 years for books and records
- Firm policy: Consider 7+ years for AI governance

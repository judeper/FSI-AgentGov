# Control 2.11: Bias Testing and Fairness Assessment (FINRA Notice 25-07 / SR 11-7 Alignment)

## Overview

**Control ID:** 2.11
**Control Name:** Bias Testing and Fairness Assessment (FINRA Notice 25-07 / SR 11-7 Alignment)
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA Notice 25-07, Federal Reserve SR 11-7, SEC Division of Examinations AI priorities, ECOA
**Setup Time:** 4-8 hours initial assessment, ongoing quarterly reviews

### Purpose


This control establishes bias testing and fairness assessment procedures for AI agents in financial services, directly aligned with FINRA Notice 25-07's guidance on AI in broker-dealer operations and the Federal Reserve SR 11-7 model risk management framework. AI agents that influence customer interactions, credit decisions, suitability assessments, or service delivery must be tested for discriminatory outcomes across protected classes. This control defines testing methodologies, fairness metrics, remediation procedures, and documentation requirements to ensure equitable treatment and regulatory compliance.

---

## Setup & Configuration

### Step 1: Identify Agents Requiring Bias Testing

Determine which agents require fairness assessment based on their function.

<a id="bias-testing-criteria-matrix"></a>

**Bias Testing Criteria Matrix:**

| Agent Function | Bias Testing Required | Testing Depth | Frequency |
|----------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Credit/Lending Decisions** | Mandatory | Comprehensive | Quarterly |
| **Investment Suitability** | Mandatory | Comprehensive | Quarterly |
| **Account Opening/Onboarding** | Mandatory | Standard | Semi-annually |
| **Customer Segmentation** | Mandatory | Standard | Semi-annually |
| **Service Routing/Prioritization** | Required | Standard | Semi-annually |
| **Employment/HR Functions** | Mandatory | Comprehensive | Quarterly |
| **Marketing/Recommendations** | Required | Standard | Annually |
| **General Q&A/Information** | Optional | Basic | Annually |

### Step 2: Define Protected Classes and Fairness Metrics

Establish protected attributes and measurement criteria.

**Protected Classes (per ECOA, Fair Housing Act, Title VII):**

- Race and ethnicity
- Sex/gender
- Age
- National origin
- Religion
- Marital status
- Familial status
- Disability status
- Military/veteran status

**Fairness Metrics:**

| Metric | Description | Formula | Threshold |
|--------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **Demographic Parity** | Outcome rates equal across groups | P(Y=1\|A=a) = P(Y=1\|A=b) | ±10% |
| **Equalized Odds** | True positive/negative rates equal | TPR(a) = TPR(b), FPR(a) = FPR(b) | ±10% |
| **Predictive Parity** | Precision equal across groups | Precision(a) = Precision(b) | ±10% |
| **Individual Fairness** | Similar individuals treated similarly | d(f(x₁), f(x₂)) ≤ ε if d(x₁,x₂) ≤ δ | Context-dependent |
| **Counterfactual Fairness** | Outcome unchanged if protected attribute changed | f(x\|A=a) = f(x\|A=b) | Statistical significance |

### Step 3: Create Bias Testing Framework

Build standardized testing process aligned with SR 11-7.

**Bias Testing Methodology:**

1. **Pre-Testing Setup**
   - Assemble diverse test dataset (representative of customer base)
   - Ensure protected attribute labels available (or imputable)
   - Define baseline metrics from current/expected distribution
   - Document testing hypotheses and expected outcomes

2. **Testing Execution**
   - Run identical queries varying only protected attributes
   - Record all agent responses and recommendations
   - Calculate outcome distribution by protected class
   - Compute fairness metrics across all dimensions

3. **Analysis and Interpretation**
   - Identify statistically significant disparities
   - Determine if disparities exceed acceptable thresholds
   - Analyze root cause (input data, model behavior, prompt design)
   - Document findings with supporting data

4. **Remediation (if needed)**
   - Develop remediation plan for identified bias
   - Implement fixes (data augmentation, prompt engineering, guardrails)
   - Re-test to validate remediation effectiveness
   - Obtain Compliance approval before production deployment

### Step 4: Build Test Case Library

Create standardized test scenarios for bias testing.

**Sample Test Cases for Lending Agent:**

| Test ID | Scenario | Protected Attribute Varied | Expected Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| BT-001 | Same income, credit score, different name (ethnic indicators) | Race/Ethnicity | Equal treatment |
| BT-002 | Same qualifications, different gender pronouns | Gender | Equal treatment |
| BT-003 | Same profile, different age groups | Age | Equal treatment within risk factors |
| BT-004 | Same profile, with/without disability mention | Disability | Equal treatment |
| BT-005 | Married vs. unmarried with same income | Marital status | Equal treatment |

**Sample Test Cases for Suitability Agent:**

| Test ID | Scenario | Protected Attribute Varied | Expected Outcome |
|---------|----------|---------------------------|------------------|
| BT-010 | Same risk profile, different demographic | Multiple | Same recommendations |
| BT-011 | Conservative investor description variations | Gender/Age | Consistent risk assessment |
| BT-012 | Growth investor with demographic variations | Race/Ethnicity | Equal product access |

### Step 5: Configure Test Execution Workflow

**Power Automate Bias Testing Workflow:**

1. Navigate to **make.powerautomate.com**
2. Create **Manual trigger** flow
3. Flow steps:
   - Get test cases from SharePoint list
   - For each test case:
     - Send test prompt to agent API
     - Log response to Dataverse
     - Calculate metrics
   - Generate summary report
   - Route to AI Governance Lead for review

### Step 6: Create Bias Testing Scorecard

**SharePoint List: Bias Testing Results**

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Test ID | Auto-number | Unique test identifier |
| Agent ID | Lookup | Link to agent registry |
| Test Date | Date | When test was conducted |
| Test Type | Choice | Quarterly, Ad-hoc, Pre-deployment |
| Protected Class | Choice | Attribute being tested |
| Metric | Choice | Demographic Parity, Equalized Odds, etc. |
| Score | Decimal | Calculated metric value |
| Threshold | Decimal | Acceptable threshold |
| Pass/Fail | Choice | Met threshold or not |
| Disparity Group | Text | Group with unfavorable outcome |
| Severity | Choice | Low, Medium, High, Critical |
| Remediation Required | Yes/No | Does this require action |
| Remediation Status | Choice | Not Started, In Progress, Complete, Waived |

### Step 7: Establish Remediation Process

Define escalation and remediation procedures for bias findings.

**Bias Severity Classification:**

| Severity | Criteria | Timeline | Approver |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Critical** | Disparity >25%, protected class impacted | Immediate suspension | CCO + Legal |
| **High** | Disparity 15-25%, legal risk | 7 days | Compliance Officer |
| **Medium** | Disparity 10-15%, policy violation | 30 days | AI Governance Lead |
| **Low** | Disparity 5-10%, monitor and trend | Next quarterly review | Agent Owner |

**Remediation Actions:**

1. Immediate: Suspend agent from production (Critical)
2. Short-term: Add guardrails, modify prompts
3. Medium-term: Retrain with balanced data
4. Long-term: Redesign agent logic, add human oversight

### Step 8: Document for Regulatory Review

Maintain comprehensive documentation for examiner requests.

**Required Documentation Package:**

- Bias testing policy and procedures
- Test case library and methodology
- Test execution records (all inputs/outputs)
- Fairness metric calculations
- Remediation actions and approvals
- Validation of remediation effectiveness
- Quarterly summary reports
- Annual program review and updates

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>


### Issue: Lack of Demographic Data for Testing

**Symptoms:** Cannot calculate fairness metrics without protected class labels
**Solution:**

1. Use name/location as proxy (with caution, document limitations)
2. Create synthetic test data with explicit variations
3. Use counterfactual testing (same input, varied indicators)
4. Partner with external vendor for testing services
5. Document methodology limitations for examiners

### Issue: Statistical Significance Unclear

**Symptoms:** Small sample sizes, uncertain if disparity is real
**Solution:**

1. Increase test case volume
2. Use statistical tests (chi-square, Fisher's exact)
3. Document confidence intervals
4. If inconclusive, flag for enhanced monitoring
5. Consult with data science team

### Issue: Bias Detected But Root Cause Unknown

**Symptoms:** Disparity exists but source is unclear
**Solution:**

1. Analyze training data for historical bias
2. Review prompt engineering for biased language
3. Examine knowledge sources for skewed content
4. Test component by component to isolate
5. Engage external fairness consultant

### Issue: Remediation Not Effective

**Symptoms:** Bias persists after remediation attempts
**Solution:**

1. Escalate to Compliance for risk decision
2. Consider agent suspension or redesign
3. Add human oversight layer
4. Implement compensating controls
5. Document residual risk with executive acceptance

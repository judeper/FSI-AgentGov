# Control 2.14: Training and Awareness Program

## Overview

**Control ID:** 2.14  
**Control Name:** Training and Awareness Program  
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4512, SOX 404, GLBA 501(a), FINRA Notice 25-07  
**Setup Time:** 4-8 hours initial development, ongoing maintenance  

## Purpose

This control establishes comprehensive training and awareness programs for AI agent governance in financial services. Regulatory guidance, including FINRA Notice 25-07 and OCC 2011-12, emphasizes the need for qualified personnel to develop, deploy, and supervise AI systems. Financial institutions must ensure that employees involved in AI agent creation, approval, supervision, and oversight possess the necessary knowledge and skills. This control defines role-based training curricula, certification requirements, and ongoing competency verification to ensure personnel are qualified to manage AI governance responsibilities.

  - Reporting issues or concerns
  - Data protection when using agents
- Assessment: 5 question quiz (pass/fail)

### Step 3: Create Training Delivery Platform

**Option A: Microsoft Viva Learning**
1. Navigate to **admin.microsoft.com**
2. Go to **Settings** → **Org settings** → **Viva Learning**
3. Enable Viva Learning
4. Add custom learning content:
   - Upload SCORM packages
   - Create SharePoint learning paths
   - Link to external content providers

**Option B: SharePoint Training Site**
1. Create SharePoint site: "AI Governance Training"
2. Create document libraries:
   - Training Materials
   - Assessments
   - Completion Records
3. Build learning paths using SharePoint pages
4. Use Microsoft Forms for assessments

### Step 4: Configure Training Tracking

Create system to track completions and certifications.

**SharePoint List: Training Completion Records**

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| Employee | Person | Who completed training |
| Role | Choice | Agent Developer, Approver, etc. |
| Module | Choice | Which module completed |
| Completion Date | Date | When completed |
| Assessment Score | Number | Percentage score |
| Pass/Fail | Choice | Met threshold |
| Certification Expiry | Date | When renewal required |
| Certified | Yes/No | Currently certified |
| Manager | Person | For notification |

**Power Automate Notification Flow:**
1. Trigger: When certification nearing expiry (30 days)
2. Send reminder to employee and manager
3. If expired: Restrict access to agent governance functions
4. Send weekly summary to AI Governance Lead

### Step 5: Implement Certification Requirements

Define certification prerequisites for each role.

**Certification Matrix:**

| Role | Required Modules | Pass Score | Validity | Renewal |
|------|-----------------|------------|----------|---------|
| Agent Developer | 1, 2 | 80% | 1 year | Re-take Module 2 + assessment |
| Agent Reviewer | 1, 4 | 80% | 1 year | Re-take Module 4 + assessment |
| Agent Approver | 1, 3 | 85% | 1 year | Re-take Module 3 + assessment |
| Designated Supervisor | 1, 3, 5 | 85% | 1 year | Re-take Modules 3, 5 |
| Platform Admin | 1, 2 | 80% | 1 year | Re-take Module 2 |

**Certification Enforcement:**
- Link certification status to security group membership
- Automate removal from developer/approver groups if expired
- Block agent creation/approval workflows for uncertified users

### Step 6: Create Assessment Framework

Develop assessments for each training module.

**Sample Assessment Questions:**

**Module 1 - Fundamentals:**
1. What are the three governance zones and their purposes?
2. Which regulation specifically addresses AI in broker-dealer operations?
3. Who is responsible for quarterly AI governance program review?
4. What is the minimum retention period for AI agent records under FINRA 4511?

**Module 3 - Regulatory Compliance:**
1. According to FINRA Notice 25-07, what testing is required before AI deployment?
2. What does SR 11-7 require for AI systems classified as models?
3. Under ECOA, which protected classes must be tested for bias?
4. What is the supervisory review requirement per FINRA 3110?

**Practical Exercise (Module 2):**
- Given a scenario, identify governance zone classification
- Review sample agent configuration and identify compliance gaps
- Create test plan for sample agent

### Step 7: Establish Ongoing Awareness Program

Create continuous learning and awareness initiatives.

**Awareness Program Components:**

| Component | Frequency | Audience | Content |
|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Monthly Newsletter** | Monthly | All | AI governance updates, tips, news |
| **Regulatory Updates** | As needed | Governance team | New guidance, enforcement actions |
| **Brown Bag Sessions** | Quarterly | Interested staff | Deep dives on specific topics |
| **Case Studies** | Semi-annually | Developers, Supervisors | Lessons learned, industry examples |
| **Policy Updates** | As needed | All affected | Policy changes, new procedures |
| **Best Practice Sharing** | Ongoing | Developers | Peer learning, success stories |

### Step 8: Document Training Program

Create comprehensive program documentation.

**Training Program Documentation:**
- Training policy and requirements
- Curriculum overview and objectives
- Role-to-training mapping
- Assessment criteria and pass scores
- Certification requirements and validity
- Renewal and recertification process
- Record retention (6 years minimum)
- Annual program review process

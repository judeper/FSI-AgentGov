# Control 2.7: Vendor and Third-Party Risk Management

## Overview

**Control ID:** 2.7  
**Control Name:** Vendor and Third-Party Risk Management  
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), SOX 404, FINRA 4511, OCC 2011-12, Fed SR 11-7, Interagency Third-Party Guidance (2023)  
**Setup Time:** 1-2 hours  

---

### Purpose


Establish a comprehensive framework for identifying, assessing, and managing risks associated with third-party vendors and connectors used by AI agents in the Power Platform environment. Vendor risk management is critical for financial services organizations because AI agents frequently connect to external services, APIs, and data sources that may introduce security vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, or operational dependencies. This control ensures that all third-party relationships are properly vetted, documented, and monitored throughout their lifecycle.

---

### Description


Vendor and third-party risk management for AI agents extends traditional vendor management to address the unique risks introduced by Power Platform connectors, custom APIs, and external AI services. In financial services, third-party relationships are subject to rigorous regulatory scrutiny, and AI agents that connect to external services must be evaluated for data security, operational resilience, and regulatory compliance.

2. Navigate to **Analytics** > **Power Automate** or **Power Apps**
3. Review connector usage reports across all environments
4. Export the list of connectors in use
5. Categorize connectors by:
   - Publisher type (Microsoft, certified, independent, custom)
   - Data sensitivity (what data flows through the connector)
   - Business criticality (impact if connector fails)
  - Environment placement (Tier 1, 2, or 3)

**Document for each connector:**

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Connector Name | Official connector name |
| Publisher | Microsoft, verified publisher, or custom |
| Environments | List of environments where used |
| Data Types | What data flows through the connector |

   - Security policies and procedures
   - Data processing agreements
   - Incident response procedures
   - Business continuity plans

2. **Complete security questionnaire covering:**
   - Data encryption (transit and rest)
   - Access controls and authentication
   - Audit logging capabilities
   - Compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, FedRAMP)
   - Data residency and sovereignty
   - Subprocessor management
   - Incident notification procedures

3. **Assign risk score based on:**
   - Security posture assessment results
   - Data sensitivity classification
   - Business criticality

### Zone-Specific Configuration


**Zone 1 (Personal Productivity):**

- Apply a baseline minimum of Vendor and Third-Party Risk Management controls that impacts tenant-wide safety (where applicable), and document any exceptions for personal agents.
- Avoid expanding scope beyond the user’s own data unless explicitly justified.
- Rationale: reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low; legal/compliance can tighten later.

**Zone 2 (Team Collaboration):**

- Apply the control for shared agents and shared data sources; require an identified owner and an approval trail.
- Validate configuration in a pilot environment before broader rollout; retain evidence (screenshots/exports/logs).
- Rationale: shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied and provable.

**Zone 3 (Enterprise Managed):**

- Require the strictest configuration for Vendor and Third-Party Risk Management controls and enforce it via policy where possible (not manual-only).
- Treat changes as controlled (change ticket + documented testing); retain evidence (screenshots/exports/logs).
- Rationale: enterprise agents handle the most sensitive content and are the highest audit/regulatory risk.

## Verification & Testing

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Review connector inventory document | Complete list of all third-party connectors |

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>


### Issue: Unable to Identify All Third-Party Connectors

**Symptoms:** Incomplete connector inventory, unknown connectors discovered during audits

**Solutions:**

1. Run PowerShell scripts to enumerate connectors across all environments
2. Review Power Platform analytics for connector usage
3. Check audit logs in Microsoft Purview for connection activity
4. Enable connector activity alerts for new deployments
5. Survey environment admins for custom connector usage

### Issue: Vendor Fails to Provide SOC 2 Report

**Symptoms:** Vendor cannot provide required security documentation

**Solutions:**

1. Accept alternative certifications (ISO 27001, FedRAMP)
2. Request bridge letter if report is pending
3. Conduct independent security assessment
4. Implement compensating controls (enhanced monitoring)
5. Escalate to vendor risk committee for risk acceptance or termination

### Issue: Custom Connector Security Concerns

**Symptoms:** Custom connectors created without security review

**Solutions:**

1. Implement pre-deployment security review process
2. Enable Managed Environments to control solution deployment
3. Use solution checker to identify security issues
4. Require code review for custom connector APIs
5. Block custom connector creation except in designated environments

### Issue: Vendor Incident Notification Delayed

**Symptoms:** Vendor security incident not reported timely

**Solutions:**

1. Review contract for notification requirements
2. Assess impact to organization and report internally
3. Document timeline of vendor notification
4. Update vendor risk score based on incident handling
5. Consider contract remediation or termination

### Issue: DLP Policies Not Blocking Connectors as Expected

**Symptoms:** Users able to use connectors that should be blocked

**Solutions:**

1. Verify DLP policy is applied to correct environments
2. Check for conflicting policies (least restrictive wins)
3. Confirm connector is correctly classified in policy
4. Wait for policy propagation (up to 1 hour)
5. Verify environment is marked as Managed

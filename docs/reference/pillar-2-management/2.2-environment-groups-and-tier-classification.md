# Control 2.2: Environment Groups and Tier Classification

## Overview

**Control ID:** 2.2
**Control Name:** Environment Groups and Tier Classification
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, GLBA 501(b), SOX 302/404
**Setup Time:** 30-60 min initial setup, ongoing rule configuration

**Scope:** United States (US-only)

---

### Purpose

Environment Groups and Tier Classification provides a scalable governance mechanism that enables financial institutions to apply consistent policies across multiple Power Platform environments based on risk classification. This control is essential for FSI organizations because it supports consistent enforcement of regulatory-aligned requirements, reduces configuration drift between environments, and supports auditability by maintaining clear separation between development, testing, and production workloads. By aligning environment groups with a consistent governance model, organizations can implement tiered controls that match the sensitivity of data and criticality of business processes.

---

### Description

Environment Groups enable consistent governance policy application across multiple Power Platform environments. By grouping environments and applying rules, administrators can enforce sharing limits, channel restrictions, authentication requirements, and AI model governance at scale.

This control is designed to work with:
- **Control 2.1 (Managed Environments):** ensures each environment can participate in standardized governance and telemetry.
- **Control 2.15 (Environment Routing):** ensures makers are placed into the correct target environments that already inherit the correct environment group rules.

See [Environment groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/environment-groups) for detailed capabilities.

## Governance Levels

!!! warning
    This document uses two different concepts: - **Governance tiers (Tier 1/2/3)** are the
    risk-based classification used for environment groups and enforcement. - **Governance levels
    (Level 1-4)** describe implementation maturity (baseline → regulated/high-risk). For audit
    evidence, capture and retain both the **tier assignment** (which group) and the **level of
    implementation** (which rules and operational controls are enabled).

### Level 1 - Baseline

| Requirement | Configuration |
|-------------|---------------|
| Environment groups created | One group per governance tier minimum |
| Lifecycle classification | Development, Test, Production |
| Basic rules | Sharing rules configured |

### Level 2-3 - Recommended

| Requirement | Configuration |
|-------------|---------------|
| Tier-aligned groups | Separate groups for personal, team, and enterprise tiers |
| Comprehensive rules | Sharing, channels, authentication configured |
| Maker onboarding | Welcome content with policy guidance |
| Solution governance | Solution checker at Warn level |

### Level 4 - Regulated/High-Risk

| Requirement | Configuration |
|-------------|---------------|
| Strict tier separation | Dedicated groups per tier with no overlap |
| All security rules | Authentication, IP binding, firewall configured |
| AI governance | External models restricted, experimental disabled |
| Full audit trail | Transcripts, usage insights enabled |
| Deployment controls | Solution checker at Block, pipelines required |

---

### Governance Tier-to-Group Mapping

**Recommended structure for US FSI organizations (US-only):**

**Tier definitions (evidence-grade):**
- **Tier 1 (Personal Productivity):** Individual experimentation and learning; non-sensitive data only; lowest blast radius.
- **Tier 2 (Team Collaboration):** Shared team workloads and shared data sources; internal/confidential data; moderate blast radius.
- **Tier 3 (Enterprise Managed):** Production and enterprise-managed workloads; may include regulated data; highest audit expectations.

| Environment Group | Governance Tier | Tier | Environments | Key Rules |
|-------------------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Personal Development** | Personal Productivity | Tier 1 | Developer environments | Sharing disabled, M365 channels only |
| **Team Collaboration** | Team Collaboration | Tier 2 | Team/departmental environments | Sharing enabled, internal channels |
| **Enterprise Production** | Enterprise Managed | Tier 3 | Production environments | Strict controls, all rules enforced |
| **Enterprise Non-Prod** | Enterprise Managed | Tier 3 | UAT, staging | Same as production (pre-deployment testing) |

---

## Setup & Configuration

<a id="configuration-steps"></a>

### Step 1: Create Environment Groups

1. Open [Power Platform Admin Center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com)
2. Navigate to **Manage → Environment groups**
3. Click **+ New group**
4. Enter group name (e.g., "Team Collaboration")
5. Add description with tier classification (Tier 1/2/3), business scope, and change authority
6. Click **Save**

**Evidence to capture (minimum):**
- Screenshot: group properties page showing name/description and timestamp (or browser print-to-PDF)
- Export: environment group inventory (see **Export Environment Group Configuration**)

### Step 2: Add Environments to Groups

1. Select the environment group
2. Click **Environments** tab
3. Click **Add environments**
4. Select environments to include
5. Click **Add**

**Evidence to capture (minimum):**
- Screenshot: environments tab showing group membership list and counts
- Export: environment-to-group mapping CSV (see **Export Environment Group Configuration**)

**Dependency check:** If an environment cannot be added, validate **Managed Environments** configuration first ([Control 2.1](./2.1-managed-environments.md)).

### Step 3: Configure Rules

1. Select the environment group
2. Click **Rules** tab (shows 29 available rules)
3. Click on a rule name to configure
4. Set the appropriate value/toggle
5. Click **Save** (or **Publish rules** for batch changes)

**Evidence to capture (minimum):**
- Screenshot/PDF: Rules tab showing configured values for each tier group
- Change record: ticket/approval referencing Tier 1/2/3 intent, approver, and effective date

### Step 4: Configure Key Rules by Governance Tier

#### Tier 1 - Personal Productivity

**Allowed data:** non-sensitive only (no regulated customer data). Use synthetic/sample data when possible.

| Rule | Setting |
|------|---------|
| Sharing agents with Editor permissions | Disabled |
| Sharing agents with Viewer permissions | Disabled |
| Channel access for published agents | Teams + M365 Copilot only |
| Enable External Models | Disabled |
| Preview and experimental AI models | Enabled (for learning) |

#### Tier 2 - Team Collaboration

**Expected ownership:** named group owner and an approval trail for rule changes.

| Rule | Setting |
|------|---------|
| Sharing agents with Editor permissions | Enabled |
| Sharing agents with Viewer permissions | Enabled |
| Channel access for published agents | Teams, SharePoint enabled |
| Authentication for agents | Required |
| Solution checker enforcement | Warn |
| Maker welcome content | Team policy |

#### Tier 3 - Enterprise Managed

**Change control:** treat rule changes as controlled changes (ticket + peer review + recorded testing results).

| Rule | Setting |
|------|---------|
| Sharing agents with Editor permissions | Disabled (use ALM) |
| Sharing agents with Viewer permissions | Enabled |
| Channel access for published agents | All (with approval) |
| Authentication for agents | Required |
| Enable External Models | Disabled (unless approved) |
| Solution checker enforcement | Block |
| Unmanaged customizations | Block |
| Default deployment pipeline | Configured |

### Step 5: Publish Rules

1. After configuring all rules, click **Publish rules**
2. Rules apply to all environments in the group
3. Verify by checking individual environment settings

**Tie to Control 2.15 (Environment Routing):**
- Ensure routing policies send makers to environments that are already members of the correct Tier 1/2/3 group.
- If routing creates or provisions environments, include a post-provisioning step that assigns the new environment to the correct environment group before maker access is granted.

### PowerShell Configuration

### Connect to Power Platform

```powershell
# Install the Power Platform Admin module if not present
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell -Force -AllowClobber

# Import the module
Import-Module Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell

# Connect to Power Platform (interactive authentication)
Add-PowerAppsAccount

# For service principal authentication (recommended for automation)
$appId = "<Application-Client-ID>"
$secret = "<Client-Secret>"
$tenantId = "<Tenant-ID>"
Add-PowerAppsAccount -ApplicationId $appId -ClientSecret $secret -TenantID $tenantId
```

### Get Environment Groups

```powershell
# List all environment groups in the tenant
Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironmentGroup

# Get a specific environment group by ID
$groupId = "<EnvironmentGroup-ID>"
Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironmentGroup -EnvironmentGroupId $groupId

# List environments in a specific group
Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment | Where-Object { $_.EnvironmentGroupId -eq $groupId }
```

### Create Environment Group

!!! note
    Environment group creation is primarily performed through the Power Platform Admin Center
    portal. PowerShell support for group creation may be limited or require preview modules.

```powershell
# Check for available cmdlets (verify module version supports this)
Get-Command -Module Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell -Name "*EnvironmentGroup*"

# Portal navigation for group creation:
# Power Platform Admin Center → Manage → Environment groups → + New group
```

### Add Environments to Groups

```powershell
# Add an environment to an environment group
$environmentId = "<Environment-ID>"
$groupId = "<EnvironmentGroup-ID>"

# Using Set-AdminPowerAppEnvironment to update group membership
Set-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -EnvironmentName $environmentId -EnvironmentGroupId $groupId

# Verify the assignment
$env = Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -EnvironmentName $environmentId
Write-Host "Environment Group: $($env.EnvironmentGroupId)"
```

### Get Group Rules

```powershell
# Get environment group rules (requires appropriate API access)
# Note: Rule management is primarily done via PPAC portal
# Use the following to query environment settings that reflect group rules

$environments = Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment | Where-Object { $_.EnvironmentGroupId -eq $groupId }

foreach ($env in $environments) {
    Write-Host "Environment: $($env.DisplayName)"
    Write-Host "  Managed: $($env.Properties.governanceConfiguration.protectionLevel)"
    Write-Host "  Group ID: $($env.EnvironmentGroupId)"
}
```

### Export Environment Group Configuration

```powershell
# Export environment group configuration for documentation
$exportPath = "C:\Exports\EnvironmentGroups"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path $exportPath -Force | Out-Null

# Get all environment groups
$groups = Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironmentGroup

# Export group details
$groupExport = $groups | Select-Object @{
    Name = 'GroupId'; Expression = { $_.EnvironmentGroupId }
}, @{
    Name = 'DisplayName'; Expression = { $_.DisplayName }
}, @{
    Name = 'Description'; Expression = { $_.Description }
}, @{
    Name = 'CreatedTime'; Expression = { $_.CreatedTime }
}

$groupExport | Export-Csv -Path "$exportPath\EnvironmentGroups_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').csv" -NoTypeInformation

# Export environment-to-group mapping
$environments = Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment
$envMapping = $environments | Select-Object DisplayName, EnvironmentName, EnvironmentGroupId, @{
    Name = 'IsManaged'; Expression = { $_.Properties.governanceConfiguration.protectionLevel -eq 'Standard' }
}

$envMapping | Export-Csv -Path "$exportPath\EnvironmentGroupMapping_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd').csv" -NoTypeInformation

Write-Host "Exported $(($groups | Measure-Object).Count) groups and $(($environments | Measure-Object).Count) environments"
```

## Financial Sector Considerations

### Regulatory Context

**Primary Regulations:** FINRA 4511, GLBA 501(b), SOX 302/404

**US-only implementation notes:**
- Maintain evidence artifacts in accordance with US recordkeeping expectations (e.g., FINRA retention policies).
- Ensure environment placement and routing align with your organization’s US data residency and supervisory requirements.

| Regulation | Environment Group Support |
|------------|--------------------------|
| FINRA 4511 | Consistent recordkeeping controls across environments |
| GLBA 501(b) | Uniform data protection via sharing/channel rules |
| SOX 302/404 | Segregation of duties via tier classification |

---

### Regulatory Mapping

| Regulation | Section | Requirement | Environment Group Control |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------------------------|
| FINRA 4511 | (a)(1) | Books and records retention | Enable transcript access rules, usage insights for audit trail |
| FINRA 4511 | (b) | Supervision of communications | Channel access restrictions, sharing controls |
| GLBA | 501(b) | Safeguards for customer information | Authentication requirements, IP binding, sharing restrictions |
| SOX | 302 | Management certification | Tier classification enforces segregation of duties |
| SOX | 404 | Internal control assessment | Solution checker enforcement, unmanaged customization blocking |
| OCC | 2011-12 | Model risk management | External AI model restrictions, experimental feature controls |

### Governance Tier Environment Group Configuration

| Governance Tier | Environment Group Name | Tier | Data Classification | Key Restrictions |
|-----------------|------------------------|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Personal Productivity | FSI-Personal-Dev | Development | Non-sensitive only | No external sharing, M365 channels only, external models disabled |
| Personal Productivity | FSI-Sandbox | Development | Synthetic data only | Experimental AI enabled, no production connectors |
| Team Collaboration | FSI-Team-Collab | Test/UAT | Internal/Confidential | Team sharing allowed, internal channels, solution checker warn |
| Team Collaboration | FSI-Departmental | Departmental | Business confidential | Controlled sharing, authentication required |
| Enterprise Managed | FSI-Production | Production | All classifications | Strict controls, ALM only, no unmanaged changes |
| Enterprise Managed | FSI-Regulatory | Production | Regulatory/PII | Maximum restrictions, full audit, IP firewall enabled |

### FSI Example Configuration

### Zone-Specific Configuration

**Zone 1 (Personal Productivity):**
- Apply a baseline minimum of environment groups and tier classification that impacts tenant-wide safety (where applicable), and document any exceptions for personal agents.
- Avoid expanding scope beyond the user’s own data unless explicitly justified.
- Rationale: reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low; legal/compliance can tighten later.

**Zone 2 (Team Collaboration):**
- Apply zone-aligned rules consistently across environments for shared agents and shared data sources; require an identified owner and an approval trail.
- Validate configuration in a pilot environment before broader rollout; retain rule snapshots + group membership exports.
- Rationale: shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied and provable.

**Zone 3 (Enterprise Managed):**
- Require the strictest configuration for environment groups and tier classification and enforce it via policy where possible (not manual-only).
- Treat changes as controlled (change ticket + documented testing); retain rule snapshots + group membership exports.
- Rationale: enterprise agents handle the most sensitive content and are the highest audit/regulatory risk.

## Verification & Testing

### Evidence Pack (Audit Artifacts)

Retain an evidence pack per review period (e.g., monthly/quarterly) that an auditor can replay without requiring interactive portal access.

**Minimum evidence pack contents (recommended):**
- Environment group inventory export (CSV): group IDs, display names, descriptions, created time
- Environment-to-group mapping export (CSV): environment name, display name, group ID, managed status
- Rule configuration snapshots (PDF/screenshots) for each Tier 1/2/3 group, including “Published” status and publish timestamp
- Control linkage notes: references showing the Managed Environments baseline ([Control 2.1](./2.1-managed-environments.md)) and the routing policy intent and exception list ([Control 2.15](./2.15-environment-routing.md))
- Change log: tickets/approvals for any rule changes during the period

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to Environment groups | Groups listed with environment counts |
| 2 | Check Rules tab | Shows 29 rules with status |
| 3 | Verify rule publication | Status shows "Published" with date |
| 4 | Test in one environment per tier | Rules enforced (e.g., Tier 1 agent sharing blocked; Tier 3 unmanaged customizations blocked) |
| 5 | Add new environment to group | Inherits group rules automatically |
| 6 | Validate routing outcome ([Control 2.15](./2.15-environment-routing.md)) | A new maker is routed to a tier-appropriate environment that already inherits the correct group rules |

### PowerShell Validation (Evidence-Friendly)

Use these checks to validate and preserve evidence without relying on portal screenshots alone.

```powershell
$groupId = "<EnvironmentGroup-ID>"

# List environments in the group and confirm managed state
Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment |
  Where-Object { $_.EnvironmentGroupId -eq $groupId } |
  Select-Object DisplayName, EnvironmentName, EnvironmentGroupId,
    @{Name='IsManaged'; Expression = { $_.Properties.governanceConfiguration.protectionLevel -in @('Standard','Enhanced') }} |
  Format-Table -AutoSize
```

---

### Integration with Managed Environments

Environment Groups and Managed Environments provide layered governance:

| Control Type | Environment Groups | Managed Environments |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Scope | Multiple environments | Single environment |
| Sharing rules | Agent-level controls | Resource-level limits |
| Channels | Publishing restrictions | N/A |
| Solution checker | Via rule | Direct configuration |
| Usage insights | Via rule | Direct configuration |

**Precedence:** More restrictive setting wins when both are configured.

---

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>

| Issue | Symptoms | Resolution |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Rules not applying to environment** | Environment settings don't match group rules | Verify environment is added to the group; check that rules are published; confirm environment is managed |
| **Cannot add environment to group** | "Environment cannot be added" error | Ensure environment is a Managed Environment first ([Control 2.1](./2.1-managed-environments.md)); verify you have Environment Admin rights |
| **Rule conflicts between group and environment** | Inconsistent behavior | More restrictive setting wins; review both environment-level and group-level settings; document which takes precedence |
| **Environment group not visible** | Group doesn't appear in PPAC | Confirm Power Platform Admin role; check if group was deleted; verify tenant-level feature is enabled |
| **Published rules taking time to apply** | Settings not immediately effective | Allow up to 15 minutes for rule propagation; check Power Platform Admin Center for sync status |
| **External model rule not blocking** | External AI models still accessible | Verify rule is published; check if user has exemption; confirm environment is in the correct group |
| **Maker routed to wrong environment** | New makers land in an environment with incorrect tier rules | Review routing policy targets and exceptions ([Control 2.15](./2.15-environment-routing.md)); verify target environment is in the correct Tier 1/2/3 group; re-run validation checks and retain updated exports |
| **Tier intent unclear during audit** | Group names/descriptions do not prove Tier 1/2/3 purpose | Update group descriptions to include tier, allowed data scope, and change authority; regenerate exports and capture updated rule snapshots |

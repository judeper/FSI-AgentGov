# Control 2.19: Customer AI Disclosure and Transparency

## Overview

**Control ID:** 2.19
**Control Name:** Customer AI Disclosure and Transparency
**Regulatory Reference:** SEC Reg BI, SEC 2026 Examination Priorities (AI Washing), CFPB UDAAP, FINRA Notice 25-07, GLBA 501(b), State AI Disclosure Laws (CA SB 1001, Utah AI Policy Act, Colorado AI Act)
**Setup Time:** 3-5 hours

---

### Purpose

Establish formal processes to disclose to customers that they are interacting with AI agents, explain how the agent works, and provide clear escalation paths to human representatives. This control addresses transparency requirements across federal and state regulations and helps prevent deceptive practices by ensuring customers understand when AI is involved in their interactions.

!!! info "Why AI Disclosure Matters"
    Financial services customers have a right to know when they are interacting with AI rather than a human. Clear disclosure builds trust, supports regulatory compliance with SEC Reg BI and CFPB UDAAP requirements, and ensures customers can make informed decisions about how they receive information and services.

---

### Description

Customer AI Disclosure and Transparency establishes policies and procedures for:

- **AI Identification:** Clear disclosure that the customer is interacting with an AI agent
- **Capability Explanation:** Description of what the agent can and cannot do
- **Limitation Disclosure:** Transparent communication about AI limitations
- **Human Escalation:** Clear path to reach a human representative at any time
- **Data Use Disclosure:** Information about how conversation data is used
- **Update Management:** Processes for updating disclosures when agent capabilities change

See [SEC Regulation Best Interest FAQ](https://www.sec.gov/tm/faq-regulation-best-interest) and [CFPB Guidance on AI/ML](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/chatbots-in-consumer-finance/) for regulatory context.

### Step 3: Configure Disclosure Delivery in Copilot Studio

**Portal Path:** Copilot Studio → [Agent] → Topics → System Topics

**Option A: Greeting Topic Disclosure**

1. Open your agent in **Copilot Studio**
2. Navigate to **Topics** → **System** → **Greeting**
3. Edit the greeting to include disclosure:

```yaml
# Greeting Topic Configuration
- Message: |
    Welcome! I'm [Agent Name], an AI assistant here to help you with
    [agent purpose].

    Before we begin, please note:
    - I'm an AI, not a human representative
    - I can help with [capabilities]

    Your conversation history will be shared to help them assist you.

  Action: Transfer to agent
  Transfer context: Full conversation
  Queue: [Appropriate service queue]
```

### Step 5: Establish Disclosure Change Management

**Disclosure Change Request Workflow:**

```plaintext
Trigger: Disclosure change request submitted

Workflow:
├── Capture change details
│   ├── Current disclosure text
│   ├── Proposed changes
│   ├── Reason for change
│   └── Affected agents
├── Route for approval
│   ├── Legal review (mandatory for Zone 3)
│   ├── Compliance review (all changes)
│   └── AI Governance Lead (implementation)
├── If approved:
│   ├── Update disclosure templates
│   ├── Deploy to affected agents
│   ├── Update version control log
│   └── Notify stakeholders
├── If rejected:
│   ├── Document rejection reason
│   └── Return to requestor
└── Archive request and decision
```

**Disclosure Version Control Log:**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Version ID | Auto-number | DIS-YYYY-### |
| Effective Date | Date | When disclosure became active |
| Agent Types | Multi-select | Which agent categories |
| Disclosure Level | Choice | Basic/Standard/Comprehensive |
| Change Description | Text | What changed and why |
| Approved By | Person | Legal/Compliance approver |
| Approval Date | Date | When approved |
| Previous Version | Lookup | Link to prior version |
| Full Text | Multi-line | Complete disclosure language |

### Step 6: Configure Disclosure Monitoring

**Audit Disclosure Delivery:**

```kql
// Track disclosure delivery in agent conversations
CopilotInteraction
| where TimeGenerated > ago(7d)
| where AgentType == "CustomerFacing"
| extend DisclosureDelivered = iff(ConversationContent contains "AI assistant"
    or ConversationContent contains "artificial intelligence", true, false)
| summarize
    TotalConversations = count(),
    DisclosuresDelivered = countif(DisclosureDelivered == true),
    DisclosureRate = round(100.0 * countif(DisclosureDelivered == true) / count(), 2)
    by AgentId, AgentName
| where DisclosureRate < 100
| order by DisclosureRate asc
```

**Alert on Disclosure Failures:**

```kql
// Alert when disclosure rate drops below threshold
CopilotInteraction
| where TimeGenerated > ago(1h)
| where AgentType == "CustomerFacing"
| extend DisclosureDelivered = iff(ConversationContent contains "AI assistant", true, false)
| summarize DisclosureRate = round(100.0 * countif(DisclosureDelivered == true) / count(), 2)
| where DisclosureRate < 95
```

## Financial Sector Considerations

### Regulatory Alignment

| Regulation | Requirement | How This Control Helps |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **SEC Reg BI** | Disclose material facts about the relationship | AI nature disclosed as material fact |
| **SEC 2026 Exam Priorities** | AI Washing prevention | Capability verification framework |
| **CFPB UDAAP** | Prohibits deceptive practices | Prevents material omission about AI use |
| **FINRA Notice 25-07** | Transparency in AI use | Comprehensive disclosure framework |
| **GLBA 501(b)** | Information sharing disclosure | Data use notice included |
| **California SB 1001** | Bot disclosure requirements | Proactive compliance |
| **Utah AI Policy Act** | Clear and conspicuous AI disclosure | Transparent identification |
| **Colorado AI Act** | Consequential decision documentation | Decision audit trail |

### Capability Verification and AI Washing Prevention

!!! warning "SEC 2026 Examination Priority: AI Washing"
    The SEC has identified "AI Washing" as a 2026 examination priority. AI Washing refers to making misleading claims about AI capabilities to investors or customers. Organizations must ensure marketing claims about AI agents accurately reflect actual technical capabilities.

**AI Washing Definition:**

AI Washing occurs when organizations:

- Overstate AI agent capabilities in marketing materials
- Claim AI-driven personalization that doesn't exist
- Misrepresent the sophistication of AI decision-making
- Use AI buzzwords for non-AI functionality
- Fail to disclose AI limitations that affect service quality

**Capability Verification Requirements (Zone 3 Agents):**

| Requirement | Description | Verification Method |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Capability Inventory** | Documented list of actual agent capabilities | Technical specification review |

## AI-Generated Content Labeling

<a id="ai-content-labeling"></a>

In addition to disclosing that customers are interacting with AI, organizations should implement labeling for AI-generated content to ensure transparency throughout the customer journey. This section addresses requirements for marking, tagging, and visually indicating AI-generated outputs.

### Why AI Content Labeling Matters

- **Regulatory Compliance:** Emerging state laws (CA SB 1047, CO AI Act) require disclosure of AI-generated content
- **Customer Trust:** Clear labeling builds trust and manages expectations
- **Audit Trail:** Metadata tagging supports compliance investigations
- **Legal Protection:** Documented AI provenance helps in disputes

### AI-Generated Content Labeling Requirements

#### Required Disclaimers

All AI-generated content shared with customers should include appropriate disclaimers:

| Content Type | Disclaimer Requirement | Placement |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Real-time Chat** | "This response was generated by AI" | Footer of each response |
| **Email Communications** | "This message was generated with AI assistance" | Email signature block |
| **Documents/Reports** | "AI-Generated Content - Review Before Use" | Header or watermark |
| **Recommendations** | "AI-generated recommendation - not personalized advice" | Immediately before/after |
| **Summaries** | "AI-generated summary - verify against source" | Header of summary |

#### Disclaimer Templates by Channel

**Teams Chat/Copilot Response:**

```
[AI Response Content]

---
This response was generated by AI. For personalized advice or to speak
with a representative, reply "human" or call [phone number].
```

**Email (AI-Assisted):**

```
[Email Content]

---
This message was generated with AI assistance and reviewed by [Name/Role].
The information provided is for general purposes only and does not constitute
[financial/legal/tax] advice. Contact your advisor for personalized guidance.
```

**Document/Report:**

```
================================================================
AI-GENERATED CONTENT NOTICE
================================================================
This document was generated by an AI system on [Date].
Content should be reviewed for accuracy before use.
Source materials: [List sources if applicable]
Generated by: [Agent Name/ID]
================================================================
```

### Metadata Tagging Requirements

All AI-generated content should be tagged with metadata to support audit and compliance:

#### Required Metadata Fields

| Field | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `AI_GENERATED` | Boolean flag indicating AI generation | `true` / `false` |
| `AI_GENERATION_DATE` | Timestamp of generation | ISO 8601 |
| `AI_AGENT_ID` | Identifier of generating agent | String |
| `AI_AGENT_VERSION` | Version of agent at generation time | Semver |
| `AI_MODEL_ID` | Underlying model identifier | String (e.g., "GPT-5") |
| `AI_CONFIDENCE_SCORE` | Agent's confidence in output | 0.0 - 1.0 |
| `AI_SOURCES_CITED` | Knowledge sources used | Array of source IDs |
| `AI_HUMAN_REVIEWED` | Whether human reviewed before delivery | `true` / `false` |
| `AI_REVIEWER_ID` | Human reviewer identifier (if reviewed) | String |

#### Metadata Implementation

**SharePoint Document Properties:**

```powershell
# Add AI metadata columns to document library
$columns = @(
    @{ Name = "AI_Generated"; Type = "Boolean" },
    @{ Name = "AI_GenerationDate"; Type = "DateTime" },
    @{ Name = "AI_AgentId"; Type = "Text" },
    @{ Name = "AI_ConfidenceScore"; Type = "Number" },
    @{ Name = "AI_HumanReviewed"; Type = "Boolean" }
)

# Apply to document library
foreach ($col in $columns) {
    Add-PnPField -List "Documents" -DisplayName $col.Name `
        -InternalName $col.Name -Type $col.Type
}
```

**Copilot Studio Response Metadata:**

Configure agents to include metadata in response payloads:

```yaml
# Agent Response Metadata Configuration
response_metadata:
  include_in_all_responses: true
  fields:
    - name: "ai_generated"
      value: true
      visible_to_user: false
    - name: "generation_timestamp"
      value: "${timestamp}"
      visible_to_user: false
    - name: "agent_id"
      value: "${agent.id}"
      visible_to_user: false
    - name: "confidence_score"
      value: "${response.confidence}"
      visible_to_user: false
    - name: "sources"
      value: "${response.citations}"
      visible_to_user: true
```

### Visual Indicators for AI-Generated Content

Implement visual cues to help users identify AI-generated content:

#### Visual Indicator Standards

| Indicator Type | Description | Use Case |
|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **AI Badge** | Small "AI" icon/badge next to content | Chat responses, inline suggestions |
| **Border/Highlight** | Colored border or background | AI-generated sections in documents |
| **Watermark** | Semi-transparent watermark | PDF/printed documents |
| **Icon** | Robot or AI-specific icon | Email, chat headers |
| **Label** | Text label "AI Generated" | Reports, summaries |

#### Visual Indicator Implementation

**CSS for Web/Teams Applications:**

```css
/* AI-generated content styling */
.ai-generated-content {
    border-left: 4px solid #0078d4;
    background-color: #f0f6ff;
    padding: 12px;
    margin: 8px 0;
    position: relative;
}

.ai-generated-content::before {
    content: "AI Generated";
    position: absolute;
    top: -10px;
    left: 8px;
    background: #0078d4;
    color: white;
    padding: 2px 8px;
    font-size: 11px;
    border-radius: 3px;
}

.ai-badge {
    display: inline-block;
    background: #0078d4;
    color: white;
    padding: 2px 6px;
    border-radius: 4px;
    font-size: 10px;
    margin-left: 8px;
    vertical-align: middle;
}
```

**Adaptive Card Template (Teams/Copilot):**

```json
{
  "type": "AdaptiveCard",
  "body": [
    {
      "type": "ColumnSet",
      "columns": [
        {
          "type": "Column",
          "width": "auto",
          "items": [
            {
              "type": "Image",
              "url": "https://example.com/ai-icon.png",
              "size": "Small",
              "altText": "AI Generated"
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          "type": "Column",
          "width": "stretch",
          "items": [
            {

              "size": "Small",
              "color": "Accent",
              "weight": "Bolder"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "${response_content}",
      "wrap": true
    },
    {
      "type": "TextBlock",
      "text": "This response was generated by AI. For personalized advice, speak with a representative.",
      "size": "Small",
      "isSubtle": true,
      "wrap": true
    }
  ],
  "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
  "version": "1.5"
}
```

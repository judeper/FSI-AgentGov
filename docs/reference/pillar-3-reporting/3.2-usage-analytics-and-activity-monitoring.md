# Control 3.2: Usage Analytics and Activity Monitoring

## Overview

**Control ID:** 3.2
**Control Name:** Usage Analytics and Activity Monitoring
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, SOX 404, GLBA 501(b)
**Setup Time:** 1-2 hours

---

### Purpose


Usage analytics and activity monitoring form the backbone of effective AI governance, enabling organizations to maintain visibility into agent behavior, performance, and compliance posture. For financial services institutions, comprehensive monitoring is essential to demonstrate regulatory compliance, detect anomalies that may indicate operational or security issues, and optimize agent performance for customer-facing interactions. This control establishes the monitoring framework necessary to support audit readiness and continuous improvement.

---

### Description


Monitoring agent usage and activity is essential for governance, performance optimization, and regulatory compliance. The Power Platform Admin Center provides a comprehensive **Monitor** section with alerts, logs, and product-specific dashboards including Copilot Studio agent health metrics.

See [Power Platform Admin Center monitoring](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/admin-activity-logging) for detailed capabilities.

## Financial Sector Considerations

### Regulatory Context


**Primary Regulations:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, SOX 404, GLBA 501(b)

| Regulation | Monitoring Requirement |
|------------|----------------------|
| FINRA 4511 | Monitor AI system activity for books and records |
| SEC 17a-3/4 | Track usage of systems processing customer data |
| SOX 404 | Monitor systems in financial reporting |
| GLBA 501(b) | Track access to customer information |

### Examination Considerations

Regulators may request:

- Agent usage statistics and trends
- Performance metrics and SLA compliance
- Alert history and response documentation
- Evidence of regular monitoring reviews

---


### Regulatory Mapping

| Regulation | Section | Monitoring Requirement | Implementation |
|------------|---------|------------------------|----------------|
| FINRA 4511 | (a)(1) | Books and records for AI systems must be maintained and monitored | Enable comprehensive audit logging; configure alerts for anomalies |
| FINRA 4511 | (c) | Preserve records in accessible format | Export usage data to immutable storage; maintain 6-year retention |
| SEC 17a-3 | (a)(17) | Records of communications related to business | Track all agent interactions involving customer communications |
| SEC 17a-4 | (b)(4) | Electronic storage with audit trail | Configure audit logging with tamper-evident storage |
| GLBA 501(b) | Safeguards | Monitor access to customer NPI | Create alerts for unusual data access patterns |
| SOX 404 | Control testing | Evidence of monitoring activities | Generate weekly monitoring reports; document alert responses |

### Governance Tier Monitoring Requirements

Use governance tiers (Tier 1-3) for the control posture; do not map tiers directly to Dev/Test/Prod environment tiers.

| Requirement | Tier 1 (Personal Productivity) | Tier 2 (Team Collaboration) | Tier 3 (Enterprise Managed) |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Dashboard Review | Monthly | Weekly | Daily |
| Success Rate Threshold | >80% | >90% | >95% |
| Alert Response Time | Next business day | 4 hours | 1 hour |
| Performance SLA | None | 99% | 99.9% |
| Audit Log Retention | 90 days | 1 year | 7 years |
| Executive Reporting | Quarterly summary | Monthly summary | Weekly summary |
| Incident Escalation | Standard | Expedited | Immediate |
| Real-time Monitoring | Not required | Business hours | 24/7 |

### Zone-Specific Configuration


**Zone 1 (Personal Productivity):**

- Apply a baseline minimum of Usage Analytics and Activity Monitoring controls that impacts tenant-wide safety (where applicable), and document any exceptions for personal agents.
- Avoid expanding scope beyond the user’s own data unless explicitly justified.
- Rationale: reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low; legal/compliance can tighten later.

**Zone 2 (Team Collaboration):**

- Apply the control for shared agents and shared data sources; require an identified owner and an approval trail.
- Validate configuration in a pilot environment before broader rollout; retain evidence (screenshots/exports/logs).
- Rationale: shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied and provable.

**Zone 3 (Enterprise Managed):**

- Require the strictest configuration for Usage Analytics and Activity Monitoring controls and enforce it via policy where possible (not manual-only).
- Treat changes as controlled (change ticket + documented testing); retain evidence (screenshots/exports/logs).
- Rationale: enterprise agents handle the most sensitive content and are the highest audit/regulatory risk.

## Verification & Testing

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to PPAC → Monitor | Monitor section displayed |
| 2 | Access Alerts (Preview) | Alert rules visible |
| 3 | Review pre-built rules | Microsoft rules listed |
| 4 | Access Copilot Studio dashboard | Agent metrics displayed |
| 5 | Check success rate metric | Current success rate shown |
| 6 | Verify alert notifications | Test alert sends notification |

---

### Integration with Other Monitoring


| System | Integration | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Microsoft 365 Audit** | Unified audit log | Comprehensive activity history |
| **Azure Monitor** | Advanced analytics | Custom dashboards and alerts |
| **SIEM systems** | Log forwarding | Security monitoring |
| **GRC tools** | Compliance reporting | Regulatory evidence |

---

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>


### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Missing Usage Data** | Dashboard shows no metrics or incomplete data | Managed Environment not enabled or data latency | Verify Managed Environment is enabled; wait 24-48 hours for initial data population |
| **Alerts Not Triggering** | Conditions met but no notifications received | Notification recipients not configured or email filtering | Verify alert rule is enabled; check notification settings; add sender to safe list |
| **Incorrect Success Rates** | Reported rates don't match observed behavior | Metric calculation includes all session types | Review session definitions; filter by interaction type for accurate customer-facing metrics |
| **Audit Log Gaps** | Missing entries for specific time periods | Unified audit log latency or search scope | Audit logs may take up to 24 hours to appear; expand search date range; verify RecordType filter |
| **Performance Dashboard Timeout** | Dashboard fails to load or times out | Large data volume or environment count | Apply environment filters; reduce date range; schedule reports instead of real-time queries |

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify Managed Environment Status**
   ```powershell
   Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -EnvironmentName "env-id" | Select-Object DisplayName, IsManagedEnvironment
   ```

2. **Check Alert Rule Configuration**
   - Navigate to PPAC → Monitor → Alerts
   - Verify rule is in "Enabled" state
   - Test notification by manually triggering condition

3. **Validate Audit Log Access**
   ```powershell
   Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-1) -EndDate (Get-Date) -RecordType CopilotStudio -ResultSize 10
   ```

4. **Review Data Freshness**
   - Check "Last Updated" timestamp on dashboard
   - Data typically refreshes every 24 hours

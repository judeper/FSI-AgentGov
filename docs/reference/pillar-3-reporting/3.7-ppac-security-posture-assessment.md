# Control 3.7: PPAC Security Posture Assessment

## Overview

**Control ID:** 3.7
**Control Name:** PPAC Security Posture Assessment
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 3110, OCC 2011-12, GLBA 501(b), SOX 404
**Setup Time:** 30-45 minutes

---

### Purpose


The PPAC Security Posture Assessment enables financial institutions to proactively identify, prioritize, and remediate security gaps across their Power Platform tenant. By providing a centralized security score and actionable recommendations, this control ensures FSI organizations maintain a strong security posture aligned with regulatory expectations and industry best practices. Regular security assessments are critical for demonstrating due diligence during regulatory examinations and maintaining customer trust.

---

### Description


The Power Platform Admin Center provides a **Security** section with security posture assessment capabilities, enabling organizations to identify and remediate security gaps across their Power Platform tenant. This proactive assessment helps FSI organizations maintain compliance and reduce risk.

See [Security in Power Platform Admin Center](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/security/overview) for detailed capabilities.

## Financial Sector Considerations

### Regulatory Mapping

| Regulation | Requirement | How This Control Helps | Evidence Required |
|------------|-------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| **FINRA 3110** | Supervisory system security | Identifies security gaps in supervisory tools; tracks remediation | Security assessment reports, remediation logs |
| **OCC 2011-12** | Operational risk management | Proactive security posture monitoring reduces operational risk | Monthly assessment scores, trend analysis |
| **GLBA 501(b)** | Administrative safeguards | Ensures appropriate security controls protect customer information | Security recommendations status, implementation evidence |
| **SOX 404** | IT general controls | Security posture assessment supports ITGC compliance | Control testing documentation, exception reports |
| **SEC Regulation S-P** | Safeguard customer records | Security gaps identified before they become incidents | Assessment history, remediation timelines |
| **NIST CSF** | Identify, Protect, Detect | Aligns with NIST functions for comprehensive security program | Mapped recommendations to NIST controls |

### Tier-Specific Security Posture Requirements

| Tier | Minimum Security Score | Assessment Frequency | Escalation Threshold | Remediation SLA |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Tier 1** (Personal) | 60% | Quarterly | Score drops below 50% | 30 days for High, 90 days for Medium |
| **Tier 2** (Team) | 75% | Monthly | Score drops below 65% | 14 days for High, 45 days for Medium |
| **Tier 3** (Enterprise) | 85% | Weekly | Score drops below 80% | 7 days for Critical, 14 days for High |

### Zone-Specific Configuration


**Zone 1 (Personal Productivity):**
- Apply a baseline minimum of PPAC Security Posture Assessment controls that impacts tenant-wide safety (where applicable), and document any exceptions for personal agents.
- Avoid expanding scope beyond the user’s own data unless explicitly justified.
- Rationale: reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low; legal/compliance can tighten later.

**Zone 2 (Team Collaboration):**
- Apply the control for shared agents and shared data sources; require an identified owner and an approval trail.
- Validate configuration in a pilot environment before broader rollout; retain evidence (screenshots/exports/logs).
- Rationale: shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied and provable.

**Zone 3 (Enterprise Managed):**
- Require the strictest configuration for PPAC Security Posture Assessment controls and enforce it via policy where possible (not manual-only).
- Treat changes as controlled (change ticket + documented testing); retain evidence (screenshots/exports/logs).
- Rationale: enterprise agents handle the most sensitive content and are the highest audit/regulatory risk.

## Verification & Testing

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to PPAC → Security | Security dashboard displayed |
| 2 | Review security score | Current score visible |
| 3 | Review recommendations | Prioritized list available |
| 4 | Click on recommendation | Implementation guidance shown |
| 5 | Verify completed items | Status shows implemented |

---

### Reporting


### Executive Security Report

Include in quarterly governance reports:

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Security score | Overall tenant security | >80% |
| Critical items | Unresolved critical recommendations | 0 |
| High items | Unresolved high recommendations | <5 |
| Trend | Score improvement over time | Positive |

### Compliance Evidence

For regulatory examinations, document:
- Current security score
- Implemented recommendations
- Accepted risk decisions with justification
- Remediation timeline for open items

---

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>


### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| **Security score not updating** | Assessment runs on schedule, not real-time | Wait 24-48 hours after implementing recommendations; manually refresh the Security dashboard |
| **Recommendations not appearing** | Insufficient permissions or feature not enabled | Verify Power Platform Administrator role; ensure Managed Environments are enabled |
| **Cannot access Security section** | Missing admin role or license | Confirm Microsoft 365 E3/E5 license and Power Platform Administrator role assignment |
| **Score lower than expected** | New recommendations added or configuration drift | Review new recommendations; check for recent environment changes that may have affected score |
| **PowerShell commands failing** | Module not installed or connection expired | Run `Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell -Force`; reconnect with `Add-PowerAppsAccount` |

### Diagnostic Steps

1. **Verify Admin Access:**
   - Navigate to [Entra Admin Center](https://entra.microsoft.com) > Users > Select your account
   - Confirm **Power Platform Administrator** or **Global Administrator** role
   - Check license assignments include required SKUs

2. **Check Managed Environment Status:**
   - In PPAC, navigate to Manage > Environments
   - Verify production environments show "Managed" status
   - Enable Managed Environments if not already active

3. **Validate Audit Logging:**
   - Navigate to Microsoft Purview > Audit
   - Confirm auditing is enabled for the organization
   - Search for recent Power Platform events to verify logging

4. **Review Security Dashboard Permissions:**
   - Security section requires tenant-level admin permissions
   - Environment-level admins may not see all recommendations
   - Global Reader role provides read-only access

5. **Check for Service Health Issues:**
   - Review [Microsoft 365 Service Health](https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home#/servicehealth)
   - Check Power Platform status for any ongoing incidents
   - Delays in score updates may indicate service processing

# Control 3.9: Microsoft Sentinel Integration

## Overview

**Control ID:** 3.9  
**Control Name:** Microsoft Sentinel Integration  
**Regulatory Reference:** OCC Heightened Standards, Fed SR 11-7, FINRA 4370, SOX 404  
**Setup Time:** 8-16 hours (requires Azure subscription)  

---

### Purpose


Microsoft Sentinel integration establishes enterprise-grade security monitoring for AI agents in financial services environments. By connecting Power Platform and Copilot Studio to Sentinel's SIEM/XDR capabilities, organizations gain real-time visibility into agent behavior, automated threat detection, and centralized incident response. This integration is essential for meeting regulatory requirements around security monitoring and demonstrating proactive risk management of AI deployments.

---

### Description


Microsoft Sentinel provides SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and XDR (Extended Detection and Response) capabilities for Power Platform and Copilot Studio agents. Integration enables advanced threat detection, security analytics, and automated incident response for enterprise AI deployments.

See [What is Microsoft Sentinel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sentinel/overview) for detailed capabilities.

## Financial Sector Considerations

### Regulatory Context


**Primary Regulations:** OCC Heightened Standards, Fed SR 11-7, FINRA 4370, SOX 404

| Regulation | Sentinel Support |
|------------|------------------|
| OCC Heightened Standards | Enterprise security monitoring |
| Fed SR 11-7 | Model risk monitoring |
| FINRA 4370 | Business continuity security |
| SOX 404 | IT security controls |

### Examination Considerations

Regulators may request:

- Security monitoring architecture documentation
- Incident response procedures
- Detection rule inventory
- Incident history and resolution
- Evidence of proactive threat hunting

---


### Regulatory Mapping

| Regulation | Requirement | Sentinel Capability | Implementation Notes |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **FINRA 4511** | Supervisory records retention | Log retention and archival | Configure 7-year retention for agent interaction logs |
| **SOX 404** | IT general controls monitoring | Real-time security analytics | Deploy analytics rules for control monitoring |
| **GLBA 501(b)** | Safeguards for customer information | Threat detection and response | Enable DLP violation monitoring and automated alerts |
| **SEC 17a-4** | Electronic records preservation | Immutable log storage | Configure WORM storage for compliance data |
| **OCC Heightened Standards** | Risk management framework | Comprehensive SIEM integration | 24/7 SOC monitoring with documented procedures |
| **Fed SR 11-7** | Model risk management | AI behavior monitoring | Track agent decision patterns and anomalies |

### Monitoring Tiers (Independent of Agent Governance Zones)

This control uses three **monitoring tiers** for SIEM/SOC operations. These tiers are **not** the same thing as the Agent Governance zones (Zones 1-3).

| Tier | Monitoring Level | Data Retention | Alert Response SLA | SOC Coverage |
|------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Tier 1** | Basic | 90 days | 4 hours | Business hours |
| **Tier 2** | Standard | 1 year | 2 hours | Extended hours |
| **Tier 3** | Enhanced | 3 years | 1 hour | 24/7 |

### Zone-Specific Configuration


**Zone 1 (Personal Productivity):**

- Apply a baseline minimum of SIEM integration (Microsoft Sentinel) that impacts tenant-wide safety (where applicable), and document any exceptions for personal agents.
- Avoid expanding scope beyond the user’s own data unless explicitly justified.
- Rationale: reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low; legal/compliance can tighten later.

**Zone 2 (Team Collaboration):**

- Apply forward and correlate agent/security events for monitoring for shared agents and shared data sources; require an identified owner and an approval trail.
- Validate configuration in a pilot environment before broader rollout; retain connector config + sample alerts.
- Rationale: shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied and provable.

**Zone 3 (Enterprise Managed):**

- Require the strictest configuration for SIEM integration (Microsoft Sentinel) and enforce it via policy where possible (not manual-only).
- Treat changes as controlled (change ticket + documented testing); retain connector config + sample alerts.
- Rationale: enterprise agents handle the most sensitive content and are the highest audit/regulatory risk.

## Verification & Testing

| Step | Action | Expected Result |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| 1 | Navigate to Azure Portal → Microsoft Sentinel | Sentinel accessible |
| 2 | Verify workspace exists | Workspace listed |
| 3 | Check Data connectors | Microsoft Business Apps solution connector available |
| 4 | Review Analytics rules | Rules configured and enabled |
| 5 | Test incident creation | Test alert generates incident |
| 6 | Verify automation | Playbooks execute correctly |

## Troubleshooting & Validation

<a id="troubleshooting"></a>


### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Symptoms | Root Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Data connector not ingesting** | No Power Platform data in Sentinel | Connector misconfiguration or permissions | Verify Power Platform admin permissions; re-authenticate connector; check Activity Log in PPAC |
| **Analytics rule not triggering** | No incidents despite known events | Query syntax error or time window mismatch | Test query in Logs blade; verify QueryPeriod covers event timeframe; check rule is enabled |
| **High ingestion costs** | Unexpected Azure billing | Verbose logging or duplicate data sources | Review data volume by table; implement data collection rules to filter unnecessary logs |
| **Delayed alerts** | Incidents created hours after events | Query frequency too long or service delays | Reduce QueryFrequency; check Sentinel health in Azure Monitor; verify no service issues |
| **Playbook failures** | Automation not executing | Logic App connection expired or permissions | Check Logic App run history; re-authorize connections; verify managed identity permissions |

### Diagnostic Commands

```powershell
# Check Sentinel workspace health
Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -Name $workspaceName |
    Select-Object Name, ProvisioningState, Sku, RetentionInDays

# Verify data connector status
Get-AzSentinelDataConnector -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -WorkspaceName $workspaceName |
    Select-Object Name, Kind

# Check recent ingestion volume
Invoke-AzOperationalInsightsQuery -WorkspaceId $workspace.CustomerId -Query @"
Usage
| where TimeGenerated > ago(24h)
| summarize TotalGB = sum(Quantity)/1024 by DataType
| order by TotalGB desc

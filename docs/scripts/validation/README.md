# Validation Scripts (Documentation Examples)

This folder is reserved for **validation / evidence collection examples** referenced by control documentation.

- Scripts here should be **read-only** where possible (export, query, validate).
- Outputs should be suitable for audits/exams (timestamped exports, minimal PII, clear provenance).

## Suggested contents (to be added as controls are completed)
- Purview: audit log export and query helpers
- Power Platform: inventory exports and reconciliation reports
- Entra: Conditional Access policy export + sign-in evidence capture guidance

## Evidence note
Store validation outputs in your organization’s governed evidence repository with retention aligned to your recordkeeping policy.

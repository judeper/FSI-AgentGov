**Control ID:** 1.6
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA Notice 25-07, SEC AI priorities, GLBA 501(a), SOX 302
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

## Objective

Implement Data Security Posture Management for AI to gain comprehensive visibility into how Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio agents, and other AI applications interact with organizational data. DSPM for AI is the central hub for AI governance, providing monitoring, policy management, risk assessment, and compliance reporting.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA Notice 25-07:** AI supervision and monitoring - Activity explorer tracks all agent interactions
- **SEC AI priorities:** Transparency in AI-assisted decisions - Reports show sensitive interactions
- **GLBA 501(a):** Protection of customer information - Oversharing assessments identify exposure
- **SOX 302:** Internal controls over AI systems - Policy enforcement and audit trail
- **OCC 2011-12:** Model risk management - Data risk assessments for AI data exposure

## Control Description

DSPM for AI provides comprehensive visibility into AI interactions across Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio agents, and third-party AI applications. It helps organizations discover sensitive data exposure, monitor AI usage patterns, and implement protective policies.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| AI interaction monitoring | Track all Copilot and agent interactions with audit logging |
| Sensitive data detection | Identify sensitive info in AI prompts and responses |
| Recommendations | Guided security improvements with prioritized actions |
| Policy integration | Unified view of DLP, Insider Risk, Communication Compliance policies |
| Oversharing assessment | Identify and remediate data exposure risks |
| Activity explorer | Detailed interaction logs for investigation and compliance |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Complete all 4 Get Started steps (Audit, Browser Extension, Device Onboarding, Extended Insights)
- Review and implement high-priority recommendations
- Enable AI-specific DLP policies visible in DSPM Policies view
- Configure Activity explorer filters for enterprise agent monitoring
- Run regular oversharing assessments for agent knowledge sources
- Enable Insider Risk Management for Tier 2-3 agents
- Export Activity explorer data for compliance evidence

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Monthly dashboard review; basic monitoring | Low risk, reduced friction |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Weekly report review; DLP + DSPM policies enabled | Shared agents require consistent controls |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Daily Activity explorer review; all policy types enabled; 6-year retention | Highest audit/regulatory risk |

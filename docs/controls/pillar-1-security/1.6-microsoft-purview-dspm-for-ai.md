## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA Notice 25-07:** AI supervision and monitoring - Activity explorer tracks all agent interactions
- **SEC AI priorities:** Transparency in AI-assisted decisions - Reports show sensitive interactions
- **GLBA 501(a):** Protection of customer information - Oversharing assessments identify exposure
- **SOX 302:** Internal controls over AI systems - Policy enforcement and audit trail
- **OCC 2011-12:** Model risk management - Data risk assessments for AI data exposure

### Agent 365 Blueprint Data Governance (Preview)

> **Note:** The following guidance applies to Blueprint-registered agents using the Agent 365 SDK.

DSPM for AI provides enhanced visibility into Agent 365 Blueprint-registered agents through integration with the Observability SDK. This enables comprehensive data governance across the agent lifecycle.

**Blueprint → DSPM Data Flow:**

```
Agent 365 SDK → Observability SDK → Application Insights → DSPM Activity Explorer
     ↓                                      ↓
Blueprint Metadata              Prompt/Response Telemetry
(data sources, permissions)     (sensitive data detection)
```

| DSPM Capability | Agent 365 Integration | FSI Benefit |
|-----------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Activity Explorer** | Ingests Agent 365 telemetry via Observability SDK | Complete audit trail of agent interactions |
| **Oversharing Assessment** | Evaluates Blueprint-declared data sources | Identifies excessive data access at registration |
| **Sensitive Data Detection** | Analyzes SDK-captured prompts/responses | Detects NPI exposure in agent conversations |
| **Policy Recommendations** | Includes Agent 365-specific guidance | Tailored DLP/IRM recommendations for agents |

**Blueprint-Specific Data Classification Requirements:**

1. **Data Source Declaration** - Blueprint registration requires explicit declaration of data sources
2. **Permission Scope Validation** - DSPM evaluates whether declared permissions match data sensitivity
3. **Runtime Monitoring** - Observability SDK telemetry feeds DSPM for continuous data access monitoring

**Configuration for Agent 365:**

1. Enable DSPM for AI extended insights (Get Started > Extended Insights)
2. Configure Application Insights integration for Agent 365 SDK agents
3. Create Activity Explorer filter for `ApplicationId` matching Agent 365 workloads
4. Run oversharing assessment including Blueprint-registered agent data sources
5. Review recommendations for Agent 365-specific data protection policies

**Zone-Specific DSPM Requirements for Agent 365:**

| Zone | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Zone 1** | DSPM monitoring optional for personal agents |
| **Zone 2** | DSPM Activity Explorer review weekly; Blueprint data source validation |
| **Zone 3** | Daily DSPM review required; Oversharing assessment before Blueprint promotion |

# Control 1.17: Endpoint Data Loss Prevention (Endpoint DLP)

**Control ID:** 1.17
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), FINRA 4511, SOX 404, SEC Reg S-P, PCI DSS 4.0
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Extend Microsoft Purview DLP policies to Windows and macOS endpoints to prevent sensitive financial data from being transferred to removable media, uploaded to unauthorized cloud services, copied to restricted applications, or printed without authorization.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** Blocks USB and cloud transfer of customer NPI from endpoints
- **FINRA 4511:** Prevents unauthorized removal of books and records
- **SOX 404:** Device-level data transfer restrictions support internal controls
- **SEC Reg S-P:** Blocks exfiltration of customer privacy data via endpoint
- **PCI DSS 4.0:** Restricts removable media access for cardholder data

---

## Control Description

This control establishes endpoint protection through:

1. **Device Onboarding** - Onboard Windows/macOS devices to Microsoft Purview via Defender for Endpoint
2. **Restricted Applications** - Block sensitive data access by unauthorized applications (personal email, messaging, cloud storage)
3. **USB and Removable Media Control** - Block or audit transfers to removable storage devices
4. **Cloud Upload Protection** - Block uploads to personal cloud services (Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud)
5. **Network Share Restrictions** - Block transfers to unauthorized network locations
6. **Just-in-Time Protection** - Maintain policy enforcement during network outages

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Onboard devices via Defender for Endpoint (Group Policy, Intune, or local script)
- Configure restricted apps list (Notepad++, WinRAR, Telegram, Discord, personal email)
- Create app groups for unauthorized cloud storage and personal communication tools
- Define allowed USB devices by hardware ID (corporate-encrypted drives only)
- Configure network share groups for unauthorized locations
- Set endpoint actions per zone: Audit, Block with override, or Block (no override)
- Enable just-in-time protection for offline enforcement

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Audit-only for USB/cloud; clipboard allowed; print allowed; Bluetooth allowed | Low risk, awareness-focused |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Block with override for USB/cloud; audit clipboard; audit print; Bluetooth blocked | Team data requires protection |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Block (no override) for USB/cloud; block clipboard for labeled content; block Bluetooth/RDP | Customer-facing requires strict controls |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |

| Purview Compliance Admin | Create and manage Endpoint DLP policies |
| Entra Security Admin | Manage device onboarding, Defender for Endpoint configuration |
| Intune Administrator | Deploy client configuration, device control policies |
| Compliance Officer | Review violation reports, approve override workflows |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Target devices appear in Microsoft Purview with healthy status
2. USB transfer of labeled document is blocked/audited per policy
3. Cloud upload to unauthorized service triggers block/audit
4. User receives policy tip notification explaining the restriction
5. Violation events appear in Purview activity explorer with device details

# Control 1.16: Information Rights Management (IRM) for Documents

**Control ID:** 1.16
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), SEC Reg S-P, FINRA 4511, SOX 404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Implement persistent document protection for content accessed by Copilot Studio agents using Information Rights Management (IRM) to control viewing, editing, copying, printing, and forwarding rights, with content expiration and revocation capabilities.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** IRM prevents unauthorized copying and sharing of customer NPI
- **SEC Reg S-P:** Watermarks and access restrictions protect consumer financial information
- **FINRA 4511:** IRM audit trail provides access history for books and records
- **SOX 404:** Prevents unauthorized document distribution through internal controls

---

## Control Description

This control establishes IRM protection through:

1. **Azure Rights Management Service** - Activate Azure RMS for tenant-wide document protection
2. **IRM-Enabled Sensitivity Labels** - Create labels with encryption, access control, and content marking
3. **SharePoint Library IRM** - Enable IRM on document libraries containing agent knowledge sources
4. **Agent Access Configuration** - Grant agent service accounts minimum required rights (typically View-only)
5. **Document Tracking and Revocation** - Enable tracking of protected document access with revocation capability
6. **Auto-Labeling Policies** - Configure automatic IRM application based on sensitive information detection

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Activate Azure Rights Management Service in Microsoft 365 Admin Center
- Create sensitivity labels with encryption and rights assignment
- Grant agent service accounts Viewer rights in label permissions
- Enable IRM on SharePoint libraries with download restrictions
- Configure content expiration (90 days for enterprise managed)
- Set offline access limits (7-14 days for regulated environments)
- Enable watermarking with dynamic viewer identification
- Configure super user account for compliance access

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | IRM optional; print/copy allowed; no expiration; 30-day offline access | Low risk, flexibility needed |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | IRM required; print/copy blocked; 180-day expiration; 14-day offline | Team collaboration requires protection |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | IRM mandatory; full watermark; 90-day expiration; 7-day offline; screen capture blocked | Customer-facing requires maximum protection |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |

| Purview Info Protection Admin | Create and manage sensitivity labels, configure IRM settings |
| SharePoint Admin | Enable IRM on document libraries |
| Compliance Officer | Define protection requirements, review access logs |
| AI Governance Lead | Ensure agent access respects IRM restrictions |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Azure RMS shows "Protection is activated" status
2. IRM-enabled sensitivity labels are published and available to users
3. SharePoint library IRM blocks downloads without protection applied
4. Agent can read IRM-protected content but cannot bypass restrictions
5. Document access events appear in audit logs with viewer details

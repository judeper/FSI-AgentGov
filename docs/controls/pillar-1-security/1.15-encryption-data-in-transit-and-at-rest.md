# Control 1.15: Encryption: Data in Transit and at Rest

**Control ID:** 1.15
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), SOX 404, FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-4, PCI DSS 4.0
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Ensure all data processed by Copilot Studio agents is protected with TLS 1.2+ encryption in transit and AES-256 encryption at rest, with customer-managed keys (CMK) for regulated environments and documented key rotation procedures.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** Safeguards customer NPI with TLS 1.2+ in transit, AES-256 at rest
- **SOX 404:** Customer-managed keys provide internal controls for financial record storage
- **FINRA 4511:** Encrypted storage with audit trail protects books and records
- **SEC 17a-4:** WORM storage with encryption meets non-rewritable requirements
- **PCI DSS 4.0:** Strong cryptography protects cardholder data transmission

---

## Control Description

This control establishes encryption through:

1. **TLS 1.2+ Enforcement** - Verify all agent communications use TLS 1.2 or higher with legacy TLS disabled
2. **Microsoft Service Encryption** - Confirm default AES-256 encryption for Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams
3. **Customer Key for Microsoft 365** - Configure customer-managed keys using Azure Key Vault for Tier 2/3 environments
4. **Power Platform CMK** - Enable customer-managed encryption for Dataverse and Copilot Studio environments
5. **SharePoint Customer Key** - Apply Data Encryption Policies to agent knowledge source sites
6. **Key Rotation Schedule** - Establish rotation schedule: annual for Tier 1, semi-annual for Tier 2, quarterly for Tier 3

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Verify TLS 1.2+ enforcement at network level (test with SSL Labs)
- Create two Azure Key Vaults in different regions for Customer Key redundancy
- Use Premium SKU with HSM backing for regulated environments
- Create Data Encryption Policy (DEP) and assign to agent data locations
- Configure CMK for Power Platform environments via admin center
- Enable soft delete and purge protection on Key Vaults
- Document key rotation procedures and test recovery process

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Microsoft-managed encryption; TLS 1.2; Microsoft-managed keys | Low risk, standard protection |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Customer-managed key (Azure Key Vault Standard); TLS 1.2+; annual rotation | Team data requires additional control |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | CMK with HSM backing; TLS 1.3 + MTLS; quarterly rotation; double encryption for MNPI | Customer-facing requires maximum protection |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Entra Security Admin | Configure Customer Key, manage Key Vault access |
| SharePoint Admin | Apply DEP to SharePoint sites |
| Power Platform Admin | Configure CMK for environments |
| Compliance Officer | Validate key rotation compliance, audit encryption status |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. SSL Labs test confirms TLS 1.2+ with no legacy TLS support
2. Data Encryption Policy shows Active status in Microsoft Purview
3. Key Vault diagnostic logs flow to SIEM with access logging
4. Power Platform environment shows "Encryption key managed by customer"
5. Key rotation completed within scheduled timeframe with documentation

# Control 1.2: Agent Registry and Integrated Apps Management

**Control ID:** 1.2
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, OCC 2011-12
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all AI agents deployed across the organization, tracking ownership, data access, approval status, and lifecycle to support regulatory examination readiness and governance oversight.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Requires books and records for all electronic systems including AI agents
- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Record-keeping requirements for broker-dealers extend to AI systems
- **OCC 2011-12:** Model inventory mandate for AI/ML systems in banks
- **Fed SR 11-7:** Comprehensive inventory of models with risk ratings
- **Examination Readiness:** Enables rapid response to regulatory inquiries about AI deployments

---

## Control Description

This control establishes a centralized registry for tracking all AI agents across Microsoft 365 and Power Platform environments. The registry captures essential metadata including ownership, business purpose, data sources, connectors, approval status, and review schedule. Combined with Integrated Apps management in the M365 Admin Center, organizations can maintain complete visibility into agent deployments.

The registry serves as the authoritative source for agent governance, enabling:

1. **Inventory Management** - Know what agents exist and where they are deployed
2. **Ownership Accountability** - Track responsible individuals for each agent
3. **Approval Tracking** - Document governance approvals and risk assessments
4. **Lifecycle Management** - Monitor review schedules and decommissioning
5. **Audit Readiness** - Provide immediate response capability for examinations

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Create SharePoint list with required metadata schema (Agent ID, Owner, Zone, Data Sources, Approval Status)
- Configure M365 Integrated Apps visibility and user consent settings
- Configure Agent 365 settings in Microsoft 365 Admin Center (agent types, sharing controls, templates, user access)
- Implement automated discovery to detect unregistered agents
- Establish approval workflow requiring registration before publishing
- Configure review schedule notifications (quarterly for enterprise, monthly for customer-facing)
- Define orphaned agent detection and remediation process

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic inventory; monthly updates; minimal metadata | Low risk, self-service with guardrails |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Full metadata schema; weekly updates; team lead + IT approval | Shared data access requires accountability |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Real-time inventory; full audit trail; AI Governance Committee approval; 7-year retention | Customer-facing, regulatory examination risk |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Manage environments, run discovery scripts, configure settings |
| AI Governance Lead | Define metadata schema, approval workflow, review schedule |
| Compliance Officer | Validate regulatory alignment, review audit evidence |
| Agent Owners | Maintain accurate registry entries, complete reviews on schedule |
| SharePoint Admin | Configure registry list, permissions, automation |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. All discovered agents appear in the registry (compare PowerShell discovery with SharePoint list)
2. Published agents are visible in M365 Admin Center Integrated Apps
3. User consent settings prevent unauthorized agent deployment
4. Automated discovery detects and alerts on unregistered agents
5. Review notifications are sent on schedule for upcoming reviews

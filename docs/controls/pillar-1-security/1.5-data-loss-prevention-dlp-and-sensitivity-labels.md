# Control 1.5: Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Sensitivity Labels

**Control ID:** 1.5
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC Reg S-P, GLBA 501(b), SOX 404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Prevent sensitive financial data from unauthorized exposure through AI agents by implementing DLP policies that detect and block sensitive information in agent knowledge sources, user prompts, and agent responses. Combined with sensitivity labels, this provides comprehensive data protection for Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Studio agents.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Requires protection of customer records - DLP blocks customer PII in AI responses
- **SEC Reg S-P:** Privacy protection - sensitivity labels on customer data control AI access
- **GLBA 501(b):** Safeguard customer information - DLP helps prevent exposure of financial account numbers
- **SOX 404:** IT controls for data protection - audit logging of all DLP events
- **FFIEC Guidelines:** Data classification - label-based access control for AI agents

## Control Description

DLP policies protect sensitive information from unauthorized exposure through AI agents. When combined with sensitivity labels, DLP provides comprehensive data protection across Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio agents, and other AI applications. Integration with DSPM for AI enables oversharing detection and AI-specific policy enforcement.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| AI-aware DLP policies | Policies targeting AI applications to prevent sensitive data exposure |
| Sensitivity label enforcement | Block or warn based on content classification labels |
| Oversharing assessment | Identify data exposure risks in agent knowledge sources |
| Channel control | DLP controls which publishing channels agents can use |
| DSPM integration | Unified AI data protection and visibility |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Configure DLP policies with AI locations (Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio)
- Create sensitivity label taxonomy (Public, Internal, Confidential, Highly Confidential)
- Implement SITs for financial data (SSN, ABA routing, account numbers) per Control 1.13
- Configure label-based DLP rules to block Highly Confidential content from agents
- Use channel DLP to control where Copilot Studio agents can publish
- Enable DSPM for AI integration for oversharing assessments
- Start policies in "Test with notifications" before enforcement

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Baseline DLP policies; avoid scope beyond user's own data | Low friction while maintaining safety |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | DLP with label conditions; identified owner and approval trail | Shared agents increase blast radius |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Strictest DLP with mandatory labels; block mode enforcement | Highest audit/regulatory risk |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. DLP policies include AI locations (Microsoft 365 Copilot, Copilot Studio)
2. Sensitivity labels are created and published to appropriate users
3. Label-based DLP rules block Highly Confidential content from agents
4. SITs are validated and detecting sensitive content (per Control 1.13)
5. Test prompts with sensitive data trigger expected DLP actions
6. DLP events appear in Microsoft Purview Audit logs

# Control 1.9: Data Retention and Deletion Policies

**Control ID:** 1.9
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, GLBA 501(b), SOX 404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

## Objective

Ensure agent-related data, including conversation logs, knowledge sources, and configuration history, is retained for required regulatory periods and properly deleted when no longer needed. Proper data lifecycle management is critical for FINRA, SEC, and SOX compliance.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Retain books and records for required periods (3-6+ years)
- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Securities industry records retention (WORM or audit-trail alternative per October 2022 amendments)
- **GLBA 501(b):** Protect and retain customer NPI appropriately
- **SOX 404:** Internal control documentation retention
- **Right to Deletion:** Manage customer deletion requests within regulatory constraints

## Control Description

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Retention labels | Apply retention periods to agent data by classification |
| Retention policies | Automated retention for Copilot Studio and Power Platform logs |
| Disposition review | Workflow for compliance review before deletion |
| Legal hold | Preserve content for litigation regardless of retention |
| Audit trail | Immutable log of deletion events |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Create retention labels for agent conversations (7 years), configuration (6 years), and audit logs (10 years)
- Publish labels to Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft 365 Groups
- Create retention policies targeting Dataverse and Copilot interactions
- Configure disposition reviewers for end-of-retention workflow
- Enable legal hold procedures for litigation preservation
- Configure extended audit log retention for deletion events

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | 1-year conversation retention; automatic deletion | Minimal regulatory exposure |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | 3-year retention; manager review disposition | Shared accountability |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | 7-year retention; compliance review; WORM or audit-trail alternative for broker-dealers | Maximum regulatory protection |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. All FSI retention labels created and published
2. Retention policies distributed successfully
3. Test content retained (deletion blocked during retention)
4. Disposition review workflow triggers at retention end
5. Legal hold prevents deletion when applied
6. Audit log captures deletion events

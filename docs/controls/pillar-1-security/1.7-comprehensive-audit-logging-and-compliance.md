# Control 1.7: Comprehensive Audit Logging and Compliance

**Control ID:** 1.7
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, FINRA Notice 25-07, SEC 17a-3/4, SOX 302/404, GLBA 501(b)
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

## Objective

Implement comprehensive audit logging to capture Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Studio agent interactions, providing an evidence trail for regulatory examinations, security investigations, and compliance monitoring. For broker-dealers, this includes guidance supporting SEC 17a-4(f) WORM storage requirements.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Requires 6-year retention for customer records - agent interactions may constitute records
- **FINRA Notice 25-07:** AI-generated communications require complete prompt/response retention (no summaries)
- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Record retention for AI-assisted communications; broker-dealers may require WORM storage
- **SOX 302/404:** Internal controls over AI system logging require audit trails
- **GLBA 501(b):** Security safeguards including audit trails for data access

## Control Description

Microsoft Purview Audit provides comprehensive logging of user and admin activities across Microsoft 365, including Microsoft 365 Copilot and agent interactions. Audit logs are essential for compliance monitoring, security investigations, and regulatory examinations.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Unified audit log | Single log for all M365 activities including Copilot |
| Agent activity logging | Captures agent creation, publishing, modification, and interactions |
| Extended retention | Up to 10 years with Audit Premium |
| Search and export | Advanced query and export for investigations |
| SIEM integration | Export to Sentinel or third-party SIEM |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Enable unified audit logging at tenant level
- Configure retention policies per governance tier (180 days to 10 years)
- Search for agent-related activities: CopilotInteraction, AgentPublished, ConnectorAdded
- Export logs regularly for WORM storage (broker-dealers)
- Integrate with SIEM for real-time monitoring (Tier 2-3)
- Retain complete prompt/response pairs per FINRA 25-07 (no summaries)
- Implement adversarial pattern detection in audit log analysis

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Baseline logging; 180-day retention; monthly review | Low risk, standard coverage |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | 1+ year retention; weekly review; SIEM recommended | Shared agents require accountability |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | 6+ year retention; daily review; WORM storage if broker-dealer; SIEM required | Highest regulatory risk |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Purview Audit Admin | Configure audit logging and retention policies |
| Compliance Administrator | Search and export audit logs for examinations |
| Security Operations | SIEM integration and monitoring |
| Azure Administrator | WORM storage configuration (if applicable) |

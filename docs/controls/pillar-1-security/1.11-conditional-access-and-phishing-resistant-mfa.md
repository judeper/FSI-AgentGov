# Control 1.11: Conditional Access and Phishing-Resistant MFA

**Control ID:** 1.11
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), FINRA 4511, SEC Reg SHO, SOX 302
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Implement adaptive access control using Microsoft Entra Conditional Access to enforce risk-based policies for users creating and managing AI agents, and for agents themselves through Microsoft Entra Agent ID. This control ensures only authorized, authenticated users can create, publish, and manage agents in regulated environments.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** Strong authentication requirements for customer data access
- **FINRA 4511:** Access control and audit trails for records
- **SEC Reg SHO:** Identity verification controls
- **SOX 302:** Internal access controls for financial systems
- **FFIEC:** Risk-based MFA requirements for financial institutions

## Control Description

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Conditional Access policies | Risk-based access control for agent creators |
| Phishing-resistant MFA | FIDO2, passkeys, certificates for strong authentication |
| Agent identity protection | Entra Agent ID for AI agent governance |
| Authentication strengths | Tiered authentication requirements |
| Agent sponsorship | Human accountability for agent lifecycle |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Configure Conditional Access policies requiring MFA for all users
- Define authentication strengths (phishing-resistant for enterprise tier)
- Exclude and validate break-glass (emergency access) accounts
- Configure named locations for trusted networks
- Enable Microsoft Entra Agent ID for agent identity governance
- Assign human sponsors to Zone 2/3 agents
- Use Quarantined collection for agents pending compliance review

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Baseline MFA; document exceptions | Reduce risk while keeping friction low |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Strong auth for admin/maker roles; identified owner | Shared agents increase blast radius |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Phishing-resistant MFA enforced; policy-driven | Highest audit/regulatory risk |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Entra Security Admin | Conditional Access and MFA configuration |
| Authentication Administrator | Authentication methods management |
| Compliance Officer | Regulatory authentication requirements |
| AI Governance Lead | Agent identity governance strategy |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Conditional Access policies created and enabled for agent creators
2. Break-glass accounts excluded and verified via What if
3. Phishing-resistant MFA enforced for Tier 3 users
4. Agent ID dashboard shows managed agents with sponsors
5. Sign-in logs capture CA policy evaluation
6. Authentication method matches tier requirements

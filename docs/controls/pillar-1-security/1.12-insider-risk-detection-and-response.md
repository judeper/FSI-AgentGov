# Control 1.12: Insider Risk Detection and Response

**Control ID:** 1.12
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, GLBA 501(b), SOX 404, SEC Reg SHO
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Detect potentially malicious or inadvertent insider activities that could harm the organization, including unauthorized data extraction via agents, misuse of agent capabilities, and theft of proprietary models or configurations. This control supports data exfiltration prevention and regulatory compliance monitoring.

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** Protect customer NPI from insider misuse
- **SOX 404:** Internal control monitoring for financial data access
- **SEC Reg SHO:** Detect potential market manipulation via insider access
- **FINRA 4511:** Supervision of access to books and records
- **FINRA 3110:** Supervisory controls over trading activities

## Control Description

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Data theft detection | Detect unauthorized data extraction by departing users |
| Data leak monitoring | Identify external sharing, email exfiltration, USB copy |
| Security violations | Monitor failed access attempts and risky sign-ins |
| Agent abuse detection | Identify misuse of agent capabilities and configurations |
| ML-powered analytics | AI-driven risk pattern detection and scoring |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Enable Insider Risk Management and configure analytics
- Create policies for departing users, data leaks, and security violations
- Create custom policy for agent-related insider risk
- Configure priority user groups (agent admins, trading staff, client-facing)
- Set up HR data connector for resignation/termination triggers
- Configure investigation settings with SLAs and evidence collection
- Define alert triage workflow with escalation paths

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic data leak monitoring; high-severity alerts only | Limited scope and risk |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Data leaks + security violations; 48-hour investigation SLA | Shared data increases risk |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | All policies; 4-hour SLA for critical; automated response | Maximum protection required |

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Insider Risk Management Admin | Policy configuration and tuning |
| Insider Risk Analyst | Alert triage and review |
| Insider Risk Investigator | Case investigation and remediation |
| HR | Data connector and departing user coordination |

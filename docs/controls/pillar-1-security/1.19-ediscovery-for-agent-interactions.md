# Control 1.19: eDiscovery for Agent Interactions

**Control ID:** 1.19
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** SEC 17a-4, FINRA 4511, SOX 802, GLBA 501(b)
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Enable legal discovery and regulatory response capabilities for Copilot and Copilot Studio agent interactions by configuring eDiscovery cases, content searches, and legal holds to preserve, search, and export AI-generated content for litigation and examination response.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **SEC 17a-4:** Enables preservation and production of AI communications on regulatory demand
- **FINRA 4511:** Maintains searchable records of AI interactions as required
- **SOX 802:** Preserves documents related to audits and investigations
- **GLBA 501(b):** Protects and produces customer information in legal proceedings

---

## Control Description

This control establishes eDiscovery capabilities through:

1. **Case Management** - Create and manage eDiscovery cases for investigations
2. **Content Search** - KeyQL queries across Teams, SharePoint, Exchange for agent interactions
3. **Legal Hold** - Preserve agent-related content during litigation or regulatory inquiry
4. **Export** - Export search results in legal-defensible format
5. **Search Templates** - Pre-built KeyQL queries for common agent content searches
6. **Audit Integration** - Combine eDiscovery with audit log searches for complete evidence

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Assign eDiscovery Manager role to legal/compliance team members
- Document all agent content locations (Teams, SharePoint, Dataverse, Exchange)
- Create case templates for common regulatory inquiry scenarios
- Configure KeyQL queries for agent-specific searches (e.g., `kind:microsoftteams AND (from:"Copilot" OR subject:"Agent")`)
- Establish legal hold procedures with documented approval workflow
- Configure hold policies for SharePoint sites used as agent knowledge sources
- Retain eDiscovery evidence per retention schedule (6+ years for regulated)

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic awareness; as-needed holds; standard export | Low risk, minimal tracking |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Case-by-case holds; documented search procedures; tracked export | Team collaboration requires discoverability |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Proactive/standing holds; controlled export with approval; quarterly drills | Customer-facing agents highest regulatory risk |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. eDiscovery Manager can create cases and searches in Purview portal
2. Content search for agent interactions returns expected results
3. Legal hold successfully preserves content in identified locations
4. Export completes and produces defensible evidence package
5. eDiscovery actions appear in audit log

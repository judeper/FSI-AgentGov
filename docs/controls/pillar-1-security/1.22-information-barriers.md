# Control 1.22: Information Barriers for AI Agents

**Control ID:** 1.22
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA Rule 3110, SEC Regulation SHO, OCC 2011-12, FINRA Rule 5280
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Implement information barriers (Chinese walls) to prevent AI agents from crossing compliance boundaries between business units, ensuring agents cannot access data across research-trading, investment banking-sales, or public-private side barriers.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA Rule 3110:** Enforces supervision and separation between research and trading functions
- **SEC Regulation SHO:** Prevents trading on research information through segment barriers
- **FINRA Rule 5280:** Blocks research-trading communication to prevent trading ahead
- **OCC 2011-12:** Ensures AI respects data segregation for model risk management

---

## Control Description

This control establishes information barriers through:

1. **User Segments** - Define segments based on Azure AD attributes (Department = Research, Trading, IB, Sales)
2. **Barrier Policies** - Configure policies that block communication between segments
3. **Agent Context Inheritance** - Agents inherit barrier policies of the invoking user
4. **SharePoint Barrier Alignment** - Knowledge sources respect barrier boundaries
5. **Wall-Crossing Workflow** - Controlled exceptions with compliance approval and documentation
6. **Barrier Monitoring** - Detect and alert on potential barrier violations

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Create organization segments in Purview (IB-Research, IB-Trading, IB-InvestmentBanking, IB-Sales, IB-Compliance)
- Configure Information Barrier policies blocking cross-segment access
- Ensure all users are assigned to appropriate segments (users without segments bypass barriers)
- Validate SharePoint site permissions align with barrier policies
- Establish wall-crossing approval workflow (Compliance + Legal + Business Unit head)
- Configure KQL monitoring for cross-barrier access attempts
- Retain wall-crossing documentation for 6+ years

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Barriers inherited from user automatically | User context provides enforcement |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | SharePoint sites validated for barrier compliance; weekly audit | Team agents must stay within barrier walls |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Mandatory enforcement; knowledge source validation; real-time monitoring; formal wall-crossing | Maximum protection for regulated functions |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Purview Compliance Admin | Configure Information Barriers, define segments |
| Compliance Officer | Approve wall-crossing requests, policy decisions |
| Security Administrator | Monitor barrier enforcement, investigate violations |
| AI Governance Lead | Validate agent knowledge sources for barrier compliance |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Segments defined for all relevant business units in Purview
2. Barrier policies show Active status between designated segments
3. User in Research segment cannot access Trading content via agent
4. Wall-crossing request routes to Compliance for approval
5. Barrier audit logs capture all barrier-related decisions

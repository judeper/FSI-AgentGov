# Control 1.13: Sensitive Information Types (SITs) and Pattern Recognition

**Control ID:** 1.13
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC Reg S-P, GLBA 501(b), SOX 404, PCI-DSS
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Configure Sensitive Information Types (SITs) for automatic detection and classification of financial data including customer NPI (SSN, account numbers), regulatory identifiers (CRD, CUSIP), and material non-public information (MNPI) to enable DLP policies and AI data governance.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** Enables automatic detection and protection of customer NPI
- **SEC Reg S-P:** Identifies customer records requiring privacy protection
- **FINRA 4511:** Classifies records containing customer information for retention
- **PCI-DSS:** Detects credit card numbers in scope systems
- **SOX 404:** Identifies financial reporting data for integrity controls

---

## Control Description

This control establishes Sensitive Information Types as the foundation of data classification in Microsoft 365:

1. **Built-in Financial SITs** - Enable Microsoft-provided detectors for SSN, credit cards, bank accounts, ABA routing numbers, ITIN, CUSIP
2. **Custom FSI SITs** - Create organization-specific detectors for internal account formats, FINRA CRD numbers, MNPI indicators, trade details
3. **Keyword Dictionaries** - Build dictionaries for competitor names, financial terms, restricted entities
4. **Exact Data Match (EDM)** - Configure precise matching against actual customer data (hashed, not stored)
5. **Confidence Tuning** - Adjust thresholds to balance false positives and false negatives

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Review and enable built-in financial SITs in Purview Data Classification
- Create custom SITs for internal account number formats (regex patterns)
- Create FINRA CRD Number SIT with supporting keywords
- Build MNPI indicator SIT using keyword dictionaries
- Configure EDM classifier schema for customer data matching
- Set confidence levels by use case: High (85+) for blocking, Medium (65-75) for alerting
- Test detection in Content Explorer before policy deployment

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic built-in SITs; alert-only mode; high confidence threshold (85+) | Low risk, awareness-focused |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Built-in + basic custom SITs; alert and educate; medium-high confidence (75-85) | Team data requires classification |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Full SIT library + EDM; block on high confidence; medium threshold (65+) | Customer-facing requires comprehensive detection |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Purview Info Protection Admin | Create and manage SITs, tune confidence levels |
| Purview Compliance Admin | Review detection results, approve custom SIT definitions |
| Compliance Officer | Validate regulatory requirements for data classification |
| Legal | Review MNPI and confidential information SIT definitions |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Built-in financial SITs (SSN, credit card, bank account) are available in Purview
2. Custom SITs appear in Sensitive info types list with correct publisher
3. Test document with sample data is detected in Content Explorer within 24 hours
4. DLP test policy fires when SIT is matched in test content
5. EDM classifier shows Active status and matches exact data from source

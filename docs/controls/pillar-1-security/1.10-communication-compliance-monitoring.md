# Control 1.10: Communication Compliance Monitoring

**Control ID:** 1.10
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC Rule 17a-3, GLBA 501(b), FINRA 25-07
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

## Objective

Detect and review policy-relevant content in agent-assisted interactions, including user prompts and agent responses. This control supports supervision and review objectives for financial services by monitoring for regulatory violations, inappropriate content, and potential conduct risks.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511/25-07:** Supervision of AI-assisted communications
- **SEC Rule 17a-3:** Retention and review of customer communications
- **GLBA 501(b):** Protecting customer NPI in agent interactions
- **FINRA 3110:** Supervisory review of communications
- **MNPI Detection:** Identifying potential insider trading communications

## Control Description

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Inappropriate content detection | Detect harassment, threats, discrimination in agent interactions |
| Regulatory violation monitoring | Identify unsuitable recommendations, MNPI indicators |
| Sensitive data protection | Detect customer data in agent responses |
| AI classifiers | Machine learning detection for complex scenarios |
| Review workflow | Triage, escalation, and remediation workflow |

### Monitored Copilot and AI Locations

Communication Compliance policies can target specific M365 Copilot locations. Configure policies to include:

| Audit Event Name | Friendly Name | What's Captured |
|------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| `CopilotInteraction` | Microsoft 365 Copilot | User prompts and Copilot responses across M365 apps |
| `CopilotForM365Interaction` | Copilot for Microsoft 365 | Enterprise Copilot usage (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams) |
| `AgentInteraction` | Copilot Studio Agent | Custom agent prompts, responses, and tool invocations |
| `CopilotChat` | Copilot Chat | Business Chat / web chat interactions |
| `TeamsAIInteraction` | Teams AI Features | Copilot in Teams meetings, transcripts, and summaries |

**Policy Location Configuration:**

When creating Communication Compliance policies, select "Copilot for Microsoft 365" and "Copilot Studio" as monitored locations to capture AI-assisted communications. This enables detection of policy-relevant content in both user prompts and AI responses.

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Assign Communication Compliance roles (Admin, Analyst, Investigator, Viewer)
- Create policies for inappropriate content, regulatory violations, and customer data protection
- Enable AI-powered trainable classifiers for detection
- Configure OCR for image content detection
- Set up priority user groups for high-risk individuals
- Configure alert routing by severity level
- Document review workflow with SLAs and escalation paths

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic monitoring (harassment, threats); weekly sampling | Minimal regulatory exposure |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Standard monitoring; daily review; compliance escalation | Shared accountability |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Comprehensive monitoring; real-time alerts; all classifiers | Maximum regulatory protection |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Communication Compliance Admin | Policy configuration and management |
| Communication Compliance Analyst | Alert triage and review |
| Communication Compliance Investigator | Investigation and remediation |
| Legal | Escalation procedures and regulatory reporting |

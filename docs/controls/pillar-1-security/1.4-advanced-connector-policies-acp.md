# Control 1.4: Advanced Connector Policies (ACP)

**Control ID:** 1.4
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511(c), GLBA 501(b), SEC Rule 17a-4, SOX 404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Control which connectors and actions AI agents can use by implementing Advanced Connector Policies (ACP) and DLP boundaries. This ensures agents only access approved data sources and services with appropriate action-level restrictions.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA Rule 3110:** Requires supervision of data access - ACP controls which external data sources agents can access
- **SEC Regulation S-P:** Privacy safeguards - blocks unauthorized connectors that could leak customer NPI
- **SOX Section 404:** Internal controls - provides technical control over data integration points
- **GLBA Safeguards Rule:** Prevents unauthorized data transmission to non-secure external systems
- **FINRA 4511(c):** Requires audit logging of all connector usage for compliance examination

---

## Control Description

Advanced Connector Policies (ACP) provide granular control over which connectors and specific actions are available to AI agents in Power Platform. Combined with DLP policies, this control establishes data boundaries that prevent unauthorized data flows.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Connector Allowlisting | Explicitly approve connectors for regulated environments |
| Action-Level Control | Restrict to read-only actions by default; require approval for write/update/delete |
| DLP Integration | Business/Non-Business/Blocked classifications prevent cross-boundary data flows |
| Environment Groups | Apply consistent policies across multiple regulated environments |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Enable Managed Environments before configuring ACP (prerequisite)
- Create Environment Groups for regulated tier classification
- Configure explicit allowlist approach - only approved connectors with business justification
- Set action-level restrictions to read-only by default for high-risk connectors
- Align DLP policies with ACP to enforce data boundaries
- Block social media, public cloud storage, and consumer services
- Establish MCP (Model Context Protocol) governance for external tool integrations
- Govern Copilot plugins and extensions per the terminology table below

### Copilot Plugins and Extensions Terminology

Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Studio support various extension mechanisms. Use consistent terminology for governance:

| Microsoft Term | Also Known As | Governance Scope |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Copilot Plugins** | M365 Copilot extensions | Third-party capabilities added to M365 Copilot |
| **Copilot Connectors** | Graph connectors for Copilot | Data source integrations for Copilot grounding |
| **Power Platform Connectors** | Custom connectors, Premium connectors | API integrations used by Copilot Studio agents |
| **Copilot Studio Actions** | Agent tools, Agent actions | Specific operations agents can perform |
| **MCP Tools** | Model Context Protocol tools | External tool integrations using MCP standard |
| **Agent Skills** | Copilot Studio skills | Reusable capabilities shared across agents |

**Plugin Governance Requirements:**

1. **Copilot Plugins (M365):** Governed via Microsoft 365 Admin Center > Integrated Apps
2. **Power Platform Connectors:** Governed via DLP policies and ACP in PPAC
3. **Custom Connectors:** Require security review before Zone 2/3 deployment
4. **MCP Tools:** Require vendor assessment per Control 2.7 before enablement

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Standard DLP; Microsoft 365 Graph connectors only | Personal agents should not access customer PII |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | ACP with managed allowlist; Microsoft 365 + internal connectors only | Team agents access shared data within controlled boundaries |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Strict ACP allowlist with action-level restrictions; legal review for new connectors | Customer-facing agents require highest security |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Configure ACP, DLP policies, environment groups |
| Environment Admin | Monitor connector usage within environments |
| Security Team | Review and approve connector requests; vendor assessments |
| AI Governance Lead | Define connector allowlist policy; MCP governance framework |

## Related Controls

| Control | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| [2.1 - Managed Environments](../pillar-2-management/2.1-managed-environments.md) | Required dependency - must enable first |
| [2.2 - Environment Groups](../pillar-2-management/2.2-environment-groups-and-tier-classification.md) | Required dependency - groups needed for ACP |
| [1.5 - DLP and Sensitivity Labels](1.5-data-loss-prevention-dlp-and-sensitivity-labels.md) | Complementary control for data protection |
| [1.7 - Audit Logging](1.7-comprehensive-audit-logging-and-compliance.md) | Logs ACP policy enforcement events |
| [2.7 - Vendor Risk Management](../pillar-2-management/2.7-vendor-and-third-party-risk-management.md) | Third-party connectors require vendor assessment |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Managed Environment is enabled for all regulated environments
2. Environment Group is created with appropriate tier classification
3. ACP is configured with explicit allowlist (blocked connectors unavailable)
4. Action-level restrictions are enforced (write/delete blocked where configured)
5. DLP boundaries prevent cross-group data flows
6. All policy changes appear in Microsoft Purview Audit logs

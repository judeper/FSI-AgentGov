# Control 1.18: Application-Level Authorization and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Control ID:** 1.18
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SOX 302/404, GLBA 501(b), SEC Rule 17a-3/4
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Implement role-based access control for Power Platform and Copilot Studio ensuring users have only permissions necessary for their job functions, with separation of duties, least-privilege access, and documented role assignments.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **SOX 302/404:** Supports segregation of duties and internal control requirements
- **GLBA 501(b):** Enforces least-privilege access to customer information
- **FINRA 4511:** Provides access controls on books and records systems
- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Documents who has access to what systems for examination readiness

---

## Control Description

This control establishes RBAC through a layered security model:

1. **Tenant-Level Roles** - Power Platform Admin roles for global administration
2. **Environment-Level Roles** - Security groups restrict environment access
3. **Dataverse Security Roles** - Custom roles (Agent Publisher, Agent Viewer, Agent Tester) with specific privileges
4. **Record-Level Security** - Row-level security, sharing rules, and column-level restrictions
5. **Privileged Identity Management** - Just-in-time access for admin roles with approval workflows
6. **Access Reviews** - Quarterly reviews to validate continued need for access

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Create FSI security groups: `SG-PowerPlatform-Admins-Prod`, `SG-CopilotStudio-Makers-Prod`, `SG-CopilotStudio-Viewers-Prod`
- Create custom security roles: `FSI - Agent Publisher`, `FSI - Agent Viewer`, `FSI - Agent Tester`
- Assign roles to security groups (not individuals) for scalability
- Configure PIM for System Administrator role with 4-hour max activation and approval required
- Configure column-level security for sensitive fields (SSN, Account Balance, Credit Score)
- Establish quarterly access reviews with auto-removal for non-response
- Implement service principal credential rotation (90 days for Zone 3)

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Standard roles; self-service; annual review; PIM not required | Low risk, minimal oversight |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Team-based roles via groups; semi-annual review; PIM for admin roles; manager approval | Team data requires accountability |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Custom least-privilege roles; quarterly review; mandatory PIM; multi-level approval; all changes to SIEM | Customer-facing requires strictest controls |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Configure environment security roles, manage team assignments |
| Entra Global Admin | Create security groups, configure PIM |
| Compliance Officer | Review role assignments, validate audit evidence |
| AI Governance Lead | Define role requirements, approve role changes |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Users in `FSI - Agent Viewer` role cannot create or modify agents (read-only)
2. Users must activate PIM to access System Administrator in production
3. Security role assignments export shows all assignments documented
4. Access review completes with attestation for each role
5. Service principal credential rotation completes within 90-day window

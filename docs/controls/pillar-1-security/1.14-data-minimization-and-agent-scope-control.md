# Control 1.14: Data Minimization and Agent Scope Control

**Control ID:** 1.14
**Pillar:** Security
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), SEC Reg S-P, FINRA 4511, CCPA §1798.100
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Ensure Copilot Studio agents access only the minimum data necessary for their functions by implementing least-privilege principles, documented data access justifications, scope creep prevention controls, and regular access reviews.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** Limits agent access to customer NPI to minimum necessary for the function
- **SEC Reg S-P:** Documents data access justification for privacy compliance
- **FINRA 4511:** Provides audit trail for data access decisions
- **CCPA §1798.100:** Supports data collection minimization requirements

---

## Control Description

This control establishes data minimization through:

1. **Agent Data Access Inventory** - Map all data sources accessed by each agent (SharePoint, Dataverse, APIs, knowledge sources)
2. **Data Access Justification Framework** - Require documented business need for each data source with tiered approval workflows
3. **Connector Scope Restrictions** - Limit OAuth scopes and connector permissions to minimum required
4. **Knowledge Source Minimization** - Scope knowledge sources to specific folders rather than entire sites
5. **Automated Scope Alerts** - Alert when agents access new data sources or expand scope
6. **Quarterly Access Reviews** - Review and remove unnecessary permissions regularly

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Inventory all agent-to-data-source mappings with data classification levels
- Establish tiered approval workflow (Tier 1: self-service, Tier 2: manager, Tier 3: CISO)
- Configure DLP connector restrictions to block unnecessary connectors
- Create dedicated "Agent Access" SharePoint groups with minimal permissions
- Narrow knowledge sources to specific document libraries, not entire sites
- Configure Purview audit alerts for agent scope expansion events
- Document data access justification for each agent-data source pair

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Annual data access review; standard DLP; self-service scope changes | Low risk, minimal data access |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Quarterly review; enhanced DLP; manager approval for scope changes | Team data requires accountability |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Monthly review; strict allowlist; CISO approval; real-time monitoring | Customer-facing requires strict minimization |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Review agent configurations, manage environment settings |
| SharePoint Admin | Manage site permissions, create agent access groups |
| Purview Compliance Admin | Review data access patterns, configure alerts |
| AI Governance Lead | Define approval workflows, conduct access reviews |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. All agents have documented data access justification on file
2. Connector audit shows no unused or unjustified connectors
3. Knowledge sources are scoped to specific folders (not entire sites)
4. Scope creep alerts fire when agent accesses new data sources
5. Quarterly access review process completes with documented decisions

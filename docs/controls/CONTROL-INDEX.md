## How to Use This Framework

1. **Review the Overview** - Start with the framework overview to understand the 3 zones and 4 pillars
2. **Assess Current State** - For each control, review your current implementation level (Baseline, Recommended, or Regulated)
3. **Implement Controls** - Follow the implementation guidance in each control file
4. **Verify & Document** - Use the verification steps to confirm implementation and document evidence
5. **Establish Recurring Reviews** - Schedule quarterly reviews to ensure controls remain effective

---

## Governance Levels

Each control is documented with three governance levels:

- **Baseline**: Minimum required implementation
- **Recommended**: Best practice implementation for Zone 2+ agents
- **Regulated/High-Risk**: Comprehensive implementation for Zone 3 agents and regulated environments

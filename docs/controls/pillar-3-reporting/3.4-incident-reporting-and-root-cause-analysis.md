# Control 3.4: Incident Reporting and Root Cause Analysis

**Control ID:** 3.4
**Pillar:** Reporting
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), SOX 404, FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-4, FFIEC IT Handbook, SEC Regulation S-P
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

## Objective

Establish a systematic process for capturing, investigating, and remediating AI agent-related incidents including security events, policy violations, performance failures, and compliance breaches. This control ensures proper documentation, root cause analysis, and corrective actions with full audit trail for regulatory compliance.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** Requires reporting security incidents affecting customer NPI within 72 hours
- **SEC Regulation S-P:** Mandates 30-day customer notification for unauthorized access to customer information
- **SEC 17a-4:** Incident records must be preserved for 6+ years minimum
- **FINRA 4511:** Material operational events must be documented in books and records
- **SOX 404:** Control failures require immediate escalation to audit committee
- **FFIEC:** Cybersecurity incidents must be reported to primary regulator

## Control Description

This control establishes incident classification, tracking, root cause analysis, and remediation workflows for AI agent-related events. It integrates with Microsoft Sentinel for detection and SharePoint for case management.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Classification Taxonomy** | Categorize incidents by type and severity |
| **SLA Monitoring** | Track response times with automatic escalation |
| **Root Cause Analysis** | Structured RCA process with templates |
| **Regulatory Notification** | Workflows for required regulatory filings |
| **Metrics Dashboard** | Track MTTR, open issues, trends |

**Incident Categories:**

| Category | Severity Range | Example |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| Security | Critical - High | Unauthorized access, DLP violation |
| Compliance | Critical - Medium | Policy breach, missing audit records |
| Data Quality | Critical - Low | Hallucinations, calculation errors |
| Privacy | Critical - High | Customer data exposure, GLBA breach |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Create SharePoint incident tracking list with required fields (ID, category, severity, RCA, resolution)
- Configure Power Automate workflows for new incident notification and SLA breach alerts
- Define severity-based response SLAs: Critical (15 min), High (1 hr), Medium (4 hr), Low (24 hr)
- Establish RCA document template with 5-Whys or Fishbone analysis sections
- Integrate with Microsoft Sentinel for automated incident detection
- Configure regulatory notification tracking for SEC Regulation S-P 30-day requirement

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Standard response (24h); optional RCA for low severity | Low-risk personal use |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Accelerated response (4h); RCA required for all incidents | Shared data increases risk |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Immediate response (15min); full RCA required; 7-year retention | Customer-facing, regulatory examination risk |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Entra Security Admin | Configure Sentinel rules, investigate security incidents |
| Compliance Officer | Review regulatory impact, approve notifications |
| AI Governance Lead | Define classification taxonomy, oversee RCA quality |
| Platform Admin | Maintain tracking system, workflow automation |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Critical incidents trigger CISO/CCO notification within 15 minutes
2. SLA breach alerts automatically escalate overdue incidents
3. Incident closure requires completed Root Cause and Corrective Actions fields
4. Regulatory notification workflow tracks SEC S-P 30-day deadline
5. Incident records retained for 6+ years per SEC 17a-4
6. Weekly incident review meetings produce documented action items

# Control 3.6: Orphaned Agent Detection and Remediation

**Control ID:** 3.6
**Pillar:** Reporting
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SOX 404, GLBA 501(b), OCC 2011-12
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

## Objective

Identify and remediate AI agents that lack assigned owners, have been abandoned, or are no longer actively maintained. Orphaned agents represent security, compliance, and operational risks that must be addressed through automated detection and structured remediation workflows.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Unowned agents may generate records without proper supervision
- **SOX 404:** Orphaned agents bypass IT general controls for access and change management
- **GLBA 501(b):** Unmanaged agents accessing customer data violate safeguard requirements
- **OCC 2011-12:** Third-party risk extends to unmonitored agent deployments
- **Security Risk:** Orphaned agents are prime targets for exploitation

## Control Description

This control establishes automated detection of orphaned agents through owner status monitoring, inactivity tracking, and environment health checks. Remediation workflows ensure proper reassignment, archival, or deletion with appropriate approvals.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Owner Monitoring** | Detect when agent owner departs or becomes inactive |
| **Activity Tracking** | Flag agents with zero activity for 90+ days |
| **Health Checks** | Identify agents with broken connectors or environments |
| **Remediation Workflow** | Structured process for reassign/archive/delete |
| **SLA Enforcement** | Time-bound remediation with escalation |

**Orphan Categories:**

| Category | Risk Level | Remediation SLA |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Owner Departed | Critical | 14 days |
| Environment Deleted | Critical | 3 days |
| No Activity (90d) | Medium | 30 days |
| License Expired | High | 7 days |
| Connector Broken | Medium | 14 days |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Define orphan criteria: owner departed, inactive 90+ days, broken connectors, deleted environment
- Create SharePoint orphan tracking list with status, assigned reviewer, and action fields
- Configure Power Automate flow for weekly automated detection against Entra ID
- Establish remediation options: Reassign (transfer to new owner), Archive (disable), Delete (permanent removal)
- Define approval requirements by zone and action type
- Set SLAs for review and remediation with automatic escalation

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Monthly detection; team lead approval for deletion | Low risk, simple remediation |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Weekly detection; manager approval for archive/delete | Team data exposure risk |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Immediate detection; director + compliance approval; auto-suspend if unresolved | Customer-facing risk, regulatory exposure |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Run detection, execute remediation actions |
| AI Governance Lead | Review orphan reports, approve sensitive actions |
| Business Unit Owner | Identify replacement owner for reassignment |
| HR Integration | Provide termination/departure notifications |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Weekly orphan detection runs without errors and flags all orphan categories
2. Orphan count in M365 Admin Center Agents > Overview matches detection results
3. Remediation SLAs are tracked with automatic escalation at breach
4. Reassignment transfers all permissions and metadata to new owner
5. Archived agents are disabled and inaccessible to users
6. Deletion requires documented approval per zone requirements

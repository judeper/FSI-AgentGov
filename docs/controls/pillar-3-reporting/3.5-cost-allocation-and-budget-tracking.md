# Control 3.5: Cost Allocation and Budget Tracking

**Control ID:** 3.5
**Pillar:** Reporting
**Regulatory Reference:** SOX 404, GLBA 501(b), OCC 2011-12, FINRA 4511
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish comprehensive cost visibility, allocation, and budget management for AI agent deployments. This control enables accurate chargeback to business units, budget enforcement, and cost optimization while providing audit evidence for IT expenditure governance.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **SOX 404:** IT cost controls require documented allocation methodology and variance tracking
- **GLBA 501(b):** Safeguard costs must be allocated to protect customer information
- **OCC 2011-12:** Third-party technology costs require documented oversight and budget controls
- **FINRA 4511:** Technology expenditures must be documented in books and records
- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Examiners review IT spending controls and governance processes

## Control Description

This control implements cost tracking, allocation, and budget management across Power Platform, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and Azure-based AI services. It integrates with Azure Cost Management, Power Platform Admin Center, and M365 Admin Center for comprehensive visibility.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Capacity Monitoring** | Track Dataverse, AI Builder, and Copilot Studio usage |
| **Cost Allocation** | Attribute costs to business units via tagging |
| **Budget Alerts** | Automated notifications at spend thresholds |
| **Chargeback Reporting** | Monthly reports for Finance and business units |
| **License Optimization** | Track utilization to optimize licensing |

**Cost Categories:**

| Service | Billing Model | Typical Range |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Copilot Studio Messages | Per message | $0.01/message |
| M365 Copilot | Per user/month | $30/user |
| AI Builder | Per credit | $0.005/credit |
| Dataverse Storage | Per GB/month | $2/GB |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Configure environment naming convention to encode business unit for automatic attribution
- Set up Azure Cost Management with required tags (CostCenter, BusinessUnit, Zone, Owner)
- Create M365 Admin Center billing policies for Copilot by department
- Build Power BI dashboard showing costs by business unit, agent, and trend
- Configure budget alerts at 50%, 75%, 90%, and 100% thresholds
- Establish monthly chargeback process with Finance approval workflow

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Shared cost pool; no individual tracking | Low volume, overhead exceeds benefit |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Department-level allocation; quarterly review | Team budgets need visibility |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Agent-level tracking; monthly chargeback; budget approval | High-cost agents need tight controls |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Configure capacity tracking, environment tags |
| Finance Analyst | Manage chargeback, approve rate cards |
| AI Governance Lead | Set budget thresholds, review variances |
| Business Unit Owner | Approve department budgets, manage costs |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. All AI-related costs captured in Cost Management with <5% variance to billing
2. Business unit attribution accurate via environment naming and resource tags
3. Budget alerts trigger at configured thresholds (50%, 75%, 90%, 100%)
4. Monthly chargeback reports delivered to Finance by 5th business day
5. License utilization tracked with inactive licenses flagged (>30 days)
6. Cost trends visible in Power BI dashboard with 12-month history

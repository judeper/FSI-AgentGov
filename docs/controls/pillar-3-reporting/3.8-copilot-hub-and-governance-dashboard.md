# Control 3.8: Copilot Hub and Governance Dashboard

**Control ID:** 3.8
**Pillar:** Reporting
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, GLBA 501(b), SOX 404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish centralized governance of Microsoft 365 Copilot and Copilot Studio agents through the unified Copilot Hub spanning M365 Admin Center and Power Platform Admin Center. This control provides visibility into AI adoption, configuration management, and agent lifecycle governance.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Usage records support books and records requirements
- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Agent activity documentation must be preserved
- **GLBA 501(b):** Access control for customer data requires centralized oversight
- **SOX 404:** IT controls for AI systems require documented governance
- **Examination Readiness:** Copilot configuration evidence for regulators

---

## Control Description

The Copilot Hub provides unified governance across M365 Admin Center (Copilot and Agents sections) and PPAC (Copilot section). It enables centralized settings management, agent inventory, approval workflows, and usage monitoring.

| Portal | Section | Primary Functions |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| M365 Admin | Copilot | Settings, connectors, billing |
| M365 Admin | Agents | Registry, approvals, MCP Servers |
| PPAC | Copilot | Copilot Studio settings, usage |

**Key Capabilities:**

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Copilot Settings** | Organization-wide AI configuration |
| **Agent Registry** | Complete inventory of all agents |
| **Approval Workflow** | Control agent publication |
| **MCP Server Governance** | Manage agent capabilities |
| **Usage Reporting** | Track Copilot adoption and usage |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Configure Copilot Settings with FSI defaults (disable web search, block external AI)
- Review Agent Registry weekly for ownerless agents and pending requests
- Configure allowed agent types to restrict to organizational and Microsoft-verified
- Manage MCP Servers to block unnecessary data access capabilities
- Set up billing policies by department for cost allocation
- Configure PPAC Copilot Studio settings (disable Computer Use, restrict channels)
- Export usage reports monthly for compliance documentation

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Baseline settings; monthly review | Low-risk personal use |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Approval required for shared agents; weekly registry review | Team data exposure |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Strictest settings; real-time monitoring; executive reporting | Customer-facing, highest risk |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| M365 Administrator | Configure Copilot settings, manage billing |
| Power Platform Admin | Configure PPAC Copilot, Copilot Studio settings |
| AI Governance Lead | Review agent registry, approve publications |
| Compliance Officer | Validate settings meet regulatory requirements |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Copilot Settings accessible with all four tabs (User access, Data access, Actions, Other)
2. Web search for M365 Copilot disabled for compliance-sensitive environments
3. Agent Registry shows all agents with accurate owner information
4. Pending agent requests reviewed and actioned within SLA
5. Ownerless agents identified and assigned within 14 days
6. Monthly usage reports exported and archived

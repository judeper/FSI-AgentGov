# Control 3.3: Compliance and Regulatory Reporting

**Control ID:** 3.3
**Pillar:** Reporting
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, SOX 302/404, GLBA 501(b), OCC 2011-12
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish a comprehensive framework for generating, distributing, and archiving compliance reports that demonstrate AI agent governance adherence to financial services regulations. This control ensures organizations can provide evidence of regulatory compliance during examinations and audits.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Requires books and records documentation for all agent activities and governance decisions
- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Customer interaction records must be preserved in accessible, retrievable format
- **SOX 302/404:** Management certifications and internal control documentation require quarterly attestation
- **GLBA 501(b):** Safeguard effectiveness must be documented and reviewed annually
- **OCC 2011-12:** Third-party oversight and vendor compliance requires documented reporting

---

## Control Description

This control establishes automated and manual processes for compliance reporting across the AI agent governance framework. It integrates with Microsoft Compliance Manager for assessment tracking, SharePoint for document archiving, and Power BI for executive dashboards.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Control Status Reporting** | Weekly/monthly reports showing compliance by pillar |
| **Regulatory Alignment** | Mapping of controls to specific regulatory requirements |
| **Examination Packages** | Pre-built document bundles for FINRA, SEC, OCC exams |
| **Executive Dashboards** | Real-time compliance score visibility for leadership |
| **Automated Distribution** | Scheduled reports with approval workflows |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Configure Microsoft Compliance Manager assessments for FINRA, SEC, SOX, and GLBA
- Create SharePoint document library structure for report archiving with 7-year retention
- Build Power Automate flows for automated weekly/monthly/quarterly report generation
- Establish Power BI dashboard with compliance scores by pillar
- Define distribution matrix with approval workflows for executive reports
- Integrate regulatory examination calendar for deadline tracking

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Summary metrics only; Team Lead approval | Low-risk personal use requires minimal reporting |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Department-level detail; Department Head approval | Shared agents need documented compliance |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Full compliance detail; CCO/CAO approval for distribution | Customer-facing agents require comprehensive audit trail |

| Compliance Officer | Configure assessments, approve reports, regulatory liaison |
| Power Platform Admin | Set up automation flows, maintain SharePoint structure |

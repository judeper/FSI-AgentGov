## Objective

Leverage the Power Platform Admin Center Security page to assess, monitor, and improve the security posture of your Power Platform tenant. This control provides visibility into security configurations, actionable recommendations, and compliance tracking for AI agent environments.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 3110:** Supervisory procedures require documented security assessments
- **OCC 2011-12:** Third-party risk management extends to platform security posture
- **GLBA 501(b):** Safeguards rule requires ongoing security evaluation
- **SOX 404:** IT general controls must be assessed and documented
- **Examination Readiness:** Documented posture assessments demonstrate due diligence

## Control Description

The PPAC Security page provides centralized security posture assessment with recommendations, health monitoring, and audit log access. Regular review ensures environments meet FSI security requirements.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Security Overview** | Top recommendations and linked security controls |
| **Health Recommendations** | Prioritized list with status and risk level |
| **Monitor** | Access to audit logs and sign-in activity |
| **Controls** | Links to Copilot Studio and AI configuration |

**Security Page Tabs:**

| Tab | Purpose | Key Actions |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| Overview | Security recommendations summary | Review priorities |
| Health | Full recommendations list | Track remediation |
| Monitor | Audit logs and sign-ins | Activity review |
| Controls | Configuration links | Access settings |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Review Security Overview for top recommendations weekly
- Track Health recommendations by status (Not started / In progress / Completed)
- Address High-risk recommendations within 7 days
- Enable Managed Environments for Zone 2-3 (foundational security)
- Apply DLP policies to all environments
- Configure security groups for environment access control
- Generate monthly security posture reports

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Quarterly review; document exceptions | Lower risk, proportionate oversight |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Monthly review; all high-risk addressed | Shared data increases exposure |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Weekly review; 100% recommendations addressed; automated reporting | Customer-facing requires strict posture |

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Review recommendations, implement remediations |
| Security Administrator | Validate security controls, approve configurations |
| AI Governance Lead | Track posture scores, report to leadership |

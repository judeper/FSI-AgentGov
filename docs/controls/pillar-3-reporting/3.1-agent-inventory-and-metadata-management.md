# Control 3.1: Agent Inventory and Metadata Management

**Control ID:** 3.1
**Pillar:** Reporting
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, SOX 404, GLBA 501(b), NYDFS Part 500
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all AI agents across the organization to demonstrate regulatory compliance, ensure proper oversight, track ownership, and respond to regulatory examinations.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Requires maintaining books and records of all AI systems used in business operations
- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Mandates documentation of systems processing customer data with retention requirements
- **SOX 404:** Inventory of systems in financial reporting is essential for internal controls documentation
- **GLBA 501(b):** Tracking systems accessing customer information supports the Safeguards Rule
- **NYDFS Part 500:** Section 500.13 requires asset inventory with RTO/RPO, criticality, and support status

---

## Control Description

This control establishes a comprehensive agent inventory practice using both the Power Platform Admin Center (PPAC) inventory and the M365 Admin Center Agent Registry. Financial institutions must monitor both sources since they track different agent types.

The control distinguishes between a **system of record** (the authoritative inventory register used for audit and reporting) and **discovery sources** (portals and exports used to find and validate what exists). A canonical AgentID should be assigned at registration and used as the immutable join key across systems.

For NYDFS Part 500-covered entities, inventory records must include recovery objectives (RTO/RPO), criticality tier, support expiration dates, and backup compliance status.

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Access Power Platform inventory at PPAC > Manage > Inventory for Copilot Studio agents
- Access M365 Agent Registry at admin.microsoft.com > Settings > Integrated apps > Agents for declarative agents
- Establish a system of record (SharePoint list or GRC tool) as the authoritative register
- Assign a canonical AgentID that remains immutable throughout agent lifecycle
- Perform weekly reconciliation between discovery sources and system of record
- Compute SHA-256 hashes for all inventory exports to ensure evidence integrity

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Monthly inventory review with basic metadata (owner, environment, dates); document exceptions for personal agents | Reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Weekly inventory with extended metadata (purpose, data sources, approvals); require identified owner and approval trail | Shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Daily inventory reviews with comprehensive metadata (risk, validation, regulatory mapping); enforce via policy | Enterprise agents handle sensitive content and are highest audit risk |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |

| Power Platform Admin | Access and export Power Platform inventory; configure environment visibility |
| Entra Global Reader | Review inventory for compliance purposes without modification rights |
| AI Governance Lead | Define inventory governance policy; establish metadata requirements |
| Compliance Officer | Review inventory for regulatory examination readiness; validate completeness |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Power Platform inventory displays all known environments and agents
2. M365 Agent Registry shows declarative agents and extensions
3. System of record contains all agents with required metadata fields
4. Orphaned agents (missing valid owners) are identified and documented
5. Weekly inventory exports are retained with SHA-256 hash verification

# Control 3.10: Hallucination Feedback Loop

**Control ID:** 3.10
**Pillar:** Reporting
**Regulatory Reference:** CFPB UDAAP, SOX 302, FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-4
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish a systematic process for capturing, categorizing, and remediating AI agent hallucinations (factually incorrect, fabricated, or misleading outputs) to enable continuous improvement of agent accuracy and provide quality management evidence for regulatory purposes.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **CFPB UDAAP:** Tracks and remediates misleading outputs that could constitute unfair or deceptive practices
- **SOX 302:** Ensures accuracy of financial information delivered by AI agents
- **FINRA 4511:** Documents quality management processes for books and records
- **SEC 17a-4:** Preserves hallucination evidence as part of record retention requirements

---

## Control Description

This control establishes a hallucination feedback loop through:

1. **User Feedback Collection** - Thumbs down, flag, and report mechanisms
2. **Hallucination Categorization** - Taxonomy for classifying inaccuracy types (factual errors, fabrications, outdated info, calculation errors)
3. **Remediation Tracking** - Workflow with defined SLAs by severity (Critical: 4hrs, High: 24hrs, Medium: 72hrs)
4. **Trend Analysis** - Pattern identification and dashboards to detect systemic problems
5. **Continuous Improvement** - Integration with knowledge source updates and prompt refinement

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Enable user feedback (thumbs up/down) in Copilot Studio agent settings
- Define hallucination taxonomy: Factual Error, Fabrication, Outdated, Misattribution, Calculation Error, Conflation, Overconfidence, Misleading
- Create SharePoint tracking list or integrate with ServiceNow/Jira
- Configure Power Automate workflows for automated routing and escalation
- Set up trend reporting dashboards in Power BI
- Establish severity-based SLAs and escalation paths

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic thumbs up/down; quarterly review of patterns | Low risk, minimal tracking needed |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Structured feedback with categorization; weekly review; integration with team issue tracking | Shared agents need quality monitoring |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Comprehensive tracking with full workflow; real-time alerting; formal RCA for critical issues; regulatory-ready documentation | Customer-facing agents require rigorous quality control |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| AI Governance Lead | Feedback process ownership, remediation oversight, trend analysis |
| Power Platform Admin | Configure feedback mechanisms, workflow automation |
| QA Lead | Validate fixes, verify remediation effectiveness |
| Content Owner | Update knowledge sources based on root cause findings |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Test feedback via thumbs down creates tracking item with correct categorization
2. Critical hallucinations trigger incident creation within 4-hour SLA
3. Remediation workflow progresses through all status stages correctly
4. Trend reports generate and display metrics (hallucination rate, MTTR, category distribution)
5. Root cause findings integrate with knowledge source updates (Control 2.16)

## Objective

Establish comprehensive monitoring of AI agent usage, performance, and activity patterns through Power Platform Admin Center dashboards, alerts, and audit integration to support governance, compliance, and operational optimization.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Monitor AI system activity for books and records compliance
- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Track usage of systems processing customer data for examination readiness
- **SOX 404:** Monitor systems involved in financial reporting for control evidence
- **GLBA 501(b):** Track access to customer information for safeguards compliance

## Control Description

Usage analytics and activity monitoring form the backbone of effective AI governance. The Power Platform Admin Center provides a comprehensive **Monitor** section with:

| Capability | Description | FSI Relevance |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Monitor Overview** | Centralized view of platform health | Quick governance status |
| **Alerts (Preview)** | Pre-built and custom alert rules | Proactive issue detection |
| **Logs** | Activity and error logging | Audit trail and troubleshooting |
| **Copilot Studio Dashboard** | Agent-specific success metrics | Agent performance monitoring |

For environments with Managed Environments enabled, additional usage insights including weekly digests and adoption trends are available.

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Enable access to PPAC Monitor section for governance personnel
- Configure pre-built Microsoft alert rules (e.g., "High-use agents have success rate under 90%")
- Create custom alerts for organization-specific thresholds
- Set up weekly digest notifications for Managed Environments
- Configure audit log integration for compliance reporting
- Establish dashboard review cadence by governance tier

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Monthly dashboard review; >80% success rate target | Baseline visibility, low risk |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Weekly dashboard review; >90% success rate; enable alerts | Shared agents require accountability |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Daily review; >95% success rate; real-time alerting; executive reporting | Customer-facing, highest regulatory scrutiny |

|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Configure monitoring dashboards and alert rules |
| Compliance Officer | Review compliance reports, validate audit log access |
| AI Governance Lead | Define monitoring requirements, review executive summaries |

# Control 2.16: RAG Source Integrity Validation

**Control ID:** 2.16
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** Fed SR 11-7, FDIC FIL-15-2025, OCC 2011-12, FINRA 4511
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish governance over knowledge sources used for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Copilot Studio agents, ensuring content used to ground responses is accurate, current, approved, and properly attributed.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **Fed SR 11-7:** Model validation requires assessment of data inputs including knowledge sources
- **FDIC FIL-15-2025:** Third-party risk management applies to external knowledge sources
- **OCC 2011-12:** Data quality controls for model inputs apply to RAG sources
- **FINRA 4511:** Knowledge source approvals are books and records

---

## Control Description

This control establishes RAG governance through:

1. **Source Approval Workflow** - Formal approval before content becomes agent knowledge
2. **Content Versioning** - Track changes to knowledge sources over time
3. **Integrity Verification** - Validate source content hasn't been tampered with
4. **Citation Logging** - Track which sources agents use in responses
5. **Staleness Detection** - Identify outdated content requiring refresh
6. **Content Owner Accountability** - Assign owners responsible for source accuracy

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Define approved knowledge source types (SharePoint, OneDrive, Dataverse, external)
- Create SharePoint approval workflow for knowledge source additions
- Configure content versioning on knowledge libraries
- Implement metadata schema: Owner, Approval Date, Review Date, Classification
- Set staleness thresholds (90 days recommended, 30 days for regulatory content)
- Enable Copilot Studio citation tracking
- Configure Power Automate alerts for expired content

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | User-managed sources; annual review; basic versioning | Personal use has limited grounding needs |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Approved sources only; content owner assigned; quarterly review | Shared agents warrant source governance |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Formal approval workflow; mandatory versioning; staleness alerts; citation logging | Customer-facing requires maximum source integrity |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| AI Governance Lead | Define source approval criteria, oversee integrity program |
| Content Owner | Maintain source accuracy, execute periodic review |
| SharePoint Admin | Configure libraries, implement versioning and workflows |
| Compliance Officer | Approve regulatory content sources, validate retention |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Knowledge source approval workflow functions correctly
2. Content versioning enabled on all knowledge libraries
3. Metadata schema applied with Owner and Review Date fields
4. Staleness alert triggers for content past threshold
5. Citation logging captures source references in agent responses

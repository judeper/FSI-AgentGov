# Control 2.18: Automated Conflict of Interest Testing

**Control ID:** 2.18
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** SEC Reg BI, SEC Rule 10b-5, FINRA 2111, FINRA 25-07
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Implement automated testing to detect potential conflicts of interest in AI agent recommendations, particularly for agents providing product recommendations, investment guidance, or financial advice, ensuring compliance with Regulation Best Interest.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **SEC Reg BI:** Broker-dealers must act in best interest of retail customers; agents must not show bias
- **SEC Rule 10b-5:** Anti-fraud provisions prohibit self-serving recommendations
- **FINRA 2111:** Suitability requirements apply to AI-generated recommendations
- **FINRA 25-07:** AI systems must be tested for conflicts and biases

---

## Control Description

This control establishes conflict testing through:

1. **Proprietary Bias Detection** - Test for preferential recommendation of firm's own products
2. **Commission Bias Testing** - Detect bias toward higher-compensation products
3. **Cross-Selling Analysis** - Identify inappropriate bundling or upselling patterns
4. **Competitor Fairness** - Ensure competitor products aren't unfairly excluded
5. **Prompt Audit** - Review system prompts for prohibited bias instructions
6. **Scoring Validation** - Verify product scoring algorithms are unbiased

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Define conflict-of-interest test scenarios relevant to agent use case
- Create test datasets with comparable proprietary vs. competitor products
- Establish bias thresholds (e.g., proprietary recommendations should not exceed market share)
- Configure automated testing in pre-deployment pipeline
- Schedule recurring conflict testing (quarterly minimum)
- Audit system prompts for prohibited bias language
- Document testing methodology and results for examination

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Awareness only; no recommendation agents | Personal agents typically don't make recommendations |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Basic conflict testing for recommendation agents; documented methodology | Team recommendation agents warrant validation |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Comprehensive Reg BI testing; automated monitoring; independent validation; quarterly review | Customer-facing recommendations require rigorous conflict controls |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Compliance Officer | Define testing requirements, validate Reg BI alignment |
| AI Governance Lead | Configure testing, oversee methodology |
| Model Risk Manager | Independent validation of testing approach |
| Agent Owner | Remediate identified conflicts, update prompts |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Test scenarios defined for proprietary, commission, and cross-selling bias
2. Test datasets include comparable proprietary and competitor products
3. Automated conflict testing executes in pre-deployment pipeline
4. System prompts audited and free of prohibited bias instructions
5. Conflict testing report generated with statistical analysis

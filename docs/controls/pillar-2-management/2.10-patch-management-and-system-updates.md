# Control 2.10: Patch Management and System Updates

**Control ID:** 2.10
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), SOX 404, FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-4
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Implement structured patch management for AI agent infrastructure including Power Platform, Copilot Studio, and dependent Azure services to maintain security posture, operational stability, and regulatory compliance.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** Patch management protects customer information through vulnerability remediation
- **SOX 404:** Documented update processes provide internal control evidence
- **FINRA 4511:** Patch records demonstrate system maintenance for books and records
- **SEC 17a-4:** System update documentation supports recordkeeping requirements

---

## Control Description

This control establishes patch management through:

1. **Update Monitoring** - Track Microsoft 365 Message Center and Azure Service Health
2. **Impact Assessment** - Evaluate updates for agent compatibility and business impact
3. **Testing Protocol** - Test updates in non-production before production deployment
4. **Deployment Windows** - Define maintenance windows aligned with business operations
5. **Rollback Procedures** - Document rollback plans for failed updates
6. **Documentation** - Maintain patch history for compliance evidence

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Subscribe to Microsoft 365 Message Center for Power Platform and Copilot Studio updates
- Configure Azure Service Health alerts for relevant services
- Establish testing environment mirroring production configuration
- Define maintenance windows (recommended: weekends for Tier 3 agents)
- Create pre/post-patch verification checklists
- Document patch decisions and deployment outcomes in change management system
- Configure auto-update settings based on governance tier

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Auto-updates enabled; monthly review of changes | Low risk, minimal coordination needed |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Test critical updates; 48-hour validation window; documented deployment | Shared agents warrant controlled updates |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Full change control; mandatory testing; defined maintenance windows; rollback plans | Customer-facing requires maximum stability |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Monitor updates, coordinate deployments, execute patches |
| Change Manager | Approve patch schedules, manage change tickets |
| QA Lead | Execute testing protocol, validate post-patch functionality |
| Agent Owner | Assess business impact, approve maintenance windows |

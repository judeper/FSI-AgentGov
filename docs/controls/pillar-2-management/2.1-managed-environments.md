# Control 2.1: Managed Environments

**Control ID:** 2.1
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-4, GLBA 501(b), SOX 302
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Enable premium governance capabilities for Power Platform environments by designating them as Managed Environments, providing enhanced control over sharing, solution deployment, usage monitoring, and maker onboarding essential for financial services governance.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Usage insights provide activity records supporting books and records requirements
- **SEC 17a-4:** Solution checker enforces change control for recordkeeping systems
- **GLBA 501(b):** Sharing limits protect customer information from unauthorized access
- **SOX 302:** Maker welcome content documents policy acknowledgment for internal controls

---

## Control Description

Managed Environments provide premium governance capabilities for Power Platform environments, enabling centralized control over sharing, solution deployment, usage insights, and maker onboarding. When enabled, administrators gain access to governance capabilities including sharing controls, solution checker enforcement, usage insights, maker welcome content, and cross-tenant restrictions. Advanced security features such as IP Firewall, VNet support, Customer Managed Keys, and Lockbox require separate licensing and configuration beyond the Managed Environment designation.

For FSI organizations, Managed Environments are essential for enforcing governance policies at the environment level. The feature enables a "sterile default" strategy where all non-personal environments operate under controlled sharing, monitored usage, and enforced deployment gates.

Key capabilities particularly relevant for regulated financial services include:

- **Manage sharing** - Limit how widely apps, flows, and agents can be shared
- **Solution checker enforcement** - Block/warn on solution imports with security issues
- **Usage insights** - Weekly digest of top apps and flows for compliance monitoring
- **Maker welcome content** - Custom onboarding guidance communicating policy requirements
- **Cross-tenant restrictions** - Control connector access across tenant boundaries

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Enable Managed Environment status for all non-personal environments
- Configure sharing limits per resource type (Power Apps, Power Automate, Copilot Studio)
- Set solution checker enforcement level: None (Tier 1), Warn (Tier 2), Block (Tier 3)
- Enable usage insights with Compliance team as additional recipients
- Configure maker welcome content with governance policy summary and policy links
- Apply cross-tenant restrictions (disable inbound/outbound for regulated environments)

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Apply baseline minimum; document exceptions for personal agents | Reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Enable managed environment governance; require identified owner and approval trail | Shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Require strictest configuration enforced via policy; treat changes as controlled | Enterprise agents handle most sensitive content and highest regulatory risk |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Configure environment settings, enable Managed Environment, set sharing limits |
| Environment Admin | Environment-level administration and user management |
| Compliance Officer | Review usage insights, approve governance tier classifications |
| IT Governance | Define sharing limit policies and solution checker requirements |
| AI Governance Lead | Configure agent-specific sharing settings |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Managed Environment status shows enabled in PPAC environment details
2. Sharing limits block attempts to share beyond configured thresholds (test with non-admin user)
3. Solution checker blocks non-compliant solution imports (if Block mode enabled)
4. Weekly usage insights digest arrives at configured recipient addresses
5. Maker welcome content displays for new users accessing the environment

### Agent 365 Blueprint Lifecycle (Preview)

> **Note:** The following resources are preview documentation and may change.

Agent 365 Blueprints introduce 3-phase lifecycle management that aligns with Managed Environment promotion paths:

- **Phase 1: Design** - Define agent requirements and governance tier
- **Phase 2: Build** - Develop in development Managed Environment
- **Phase 3: Deploy** - Promote to production Managed Environment via Blueprint registration

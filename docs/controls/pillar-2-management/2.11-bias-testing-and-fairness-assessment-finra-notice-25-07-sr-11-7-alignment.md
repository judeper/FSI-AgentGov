# Control 2.11: Bias Testing and Fairness Assessment

**Control ID:** 2.11
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA Notice 25-07 (RFC), Fed SR 11-7, SEC AI Priorities, ECOA
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

!!! info "FINRA Notice 25-07 Status"
    FINRA Regulatory Notice 25-07 is a **Request for Comment (RFC)** with comment period
    extending to **July 2025**. Requirements described are proposed guidance, not final
    rules. Organizations should monitor FINRA communications for final rule adoption.

---

## Objective

Implement systematic bias testing and fairness assessment for AI agents to identify and remediate discriminatory outputs, ensuring compliance with fair lending laws and regulatory expectations for AI fairness in financial services.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA Notice 25-07:** Proposes testing for bias in AI systems used for investor communications (RFC - final requirements pending)
- **Fed SR 11-7:** Model validation must include assessment of potential discriminatory outcomes
- **SEC AI Priorities:** Examinations focus on AI fairness in customer-facing applications
- **ECOA:** Prohibits discrimination based on protected classes in credit decisions

---

## Control Description

This control establishes bias testing through:

1. **Protected Class Identification** - Define classes per ECOA (race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, public assistance status)
2. **Fairness Metrics** - Implement statistical measures (demographic parity, equalized odds, calibration)
3. **Test Dataset Creation** - Build representative datasets spanning protected classes
4. **Bias Detection Procedures** - Systematic testing of agent outputs across demographic groups
5. **Remediation Workflow** - Process for addressing identified bias issues
6. **Documentation** - Maintain testing evidence for regulatory examination

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Define protected classes relevant to agent use case (ECOA + state-specific)
- Create fairness test datasets with representative demographic distribution
- Establish baseline fairness metrics before deployment
- Configure automated bias testing in CI/CD pipeline for Zone 3 agents
- Set remediation SLAs: Critical bias (24h), High (7d), Medium (30d)
- Document bias testing results with statistical analysis
- Schedule recurring bias assessments (quarterly minimum for Zone 3)

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Awareness training; report suspected bias; annual review | Low external impact, basic awareness needed |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Pre-deployment bias testing; documented assessment; quarterly review | Shared agents warrant structured testing |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Comprehensive fairness assessment; automated monitoring; independent validation; remediation SLAs | Customer-facing requires rigorous bias controls |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| AI Governance Lead | Define testing requirements, oversee fairness program |
| Data Science Team | Develop fairness metrics, execute statistical analysis |
| Compliance Officer | Validate regulatory alignment, approve test methodology |
| Agent Owner | Remediate identified bias, implement corrective actions |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Protected classes documented per ECOA and applicable state law
2. Fairness test dataset includes representative demographic distribution
3. Baseline fairness metrics established and documented
4. Bias testing executed before Zone 3 agent deployment
5. Bias assessment report generated with statistical analysis and remediation recommendations

# Control 2.5: Testing, Validation, and Quality Assurance

**Control ID:** 2.5
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** SOX 302/404, FINRA 4511, GLBA 501(b), OCC 2011-12
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Ensure Copilot Studio agents function correctly, securely, and fairly before deployment to production through comprehensive testing including functional validation, security testing, performance benchmarking, bias detection, and user acceptance testing.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **SOX 302/404:** Internal control testing requires documented test procedures and results
- **FINRA 4511:** Reasonable supervision requires validated agent behavior
- **OCC 2011-12:** Model validation requires independent testing of AI behavior
- **FINRA 25-07:** AI fairness requires bias testing before deployment
- **GLBA 501(b):** Security program requires security testing verification

---

## Control Description

This control establishes comprehensive testing requirements for AI agents across the development lifecycle:

| Test Type | Description | FSI Application |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Functional Testing** | Verify agent responds correctly to user queries | Customer accuracy |
| **Security Testing** | Validate data protection and access controls | Data protection |
| **Performance Testing** | Verify agents respond within 3 seconds (Zone 1-2) or 2 seconds (Zone 3) for standard queries | Customer experience |
| **Bias Testing** | Detect and mitigate unfair treatment | FINRA 25-07 compliance |
| **Regression Testing** | Confirm changes don't break existing functionality | Change management |
| **UAT** | Business validation before production deployment | Stakeholder approval |

### Evaluation Gates

| Gate | Lifecycle Stage | Required Validations |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Gate 1** | Design > Build | Business justification, risk classification |
| **Gate 2** | Build > Evaluate | Prompt injection testing, authentication validation |
| **Gate 3** | Evaluate > Deploy | Test pass rate >95%, UAT sign-off |
| **Gate 4** | Deploy > Monitor | Compliance approval, rollback plan documented |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Establish dedicated test environments with production-equivalent configuration
- Create golden datasets with known-correct question-answer pairs (Zone 2: 50+, Zone 3: 150+ entries)
- Configure Copilot Studio Agent Evaluation metrics (groundedness, relevance, coherence)
- Implement automated regression testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Track hallucination rate with zone-appropriate thresholds (Zone 2: <5%, Zone 3: <2%)
- Require UAT sign-off from business owners before production deployment
- Retain test evidence per regulatory requirements (Zone 2: 3 years, Zone 3: 7 years)

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic functional testing; security scan only; informal documentation | Low risk, personal use |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Full test suite required; golden dataset recommended; UAT sign-off required | Shared agents require higher standards |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Comprehensive testing with independent review; golden dataset mandatory; Compliance approval | Customer-facing, regulatory examination focus |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| AI Governance Lead | Define testing standards, approve test plans |
| QA Lead | Execute test suites, manage golden datasets |
| Business Owner | Complete UAT, sign off on production readiness |
| Compliance Officer | Approve Zone 3 deployment, verify regulatory tests |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Test strategy documented with zone-appropriate requirements
2. Test environments configured and matching production settings
3. Golden dataset created with minimum entries for zone level
4. Performance testing confirms response times meet targets: <3s for Zone 1-2, <2s for Zone 3
5. Automated regression tests integrated in deployment pipeline
6. UAT sign-off obtained from business owners
7. Test evidence retained per regulatory retention policy

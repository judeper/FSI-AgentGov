# Control 2.19: Customer AI Disclosure and Transparency

**Control ID:** 2.19
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** SEC Reg BI, CFPB UDAAP, FINRA Notice 25-07, GLBA 501(b), State AI Laws
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish formal processes to disclose to customers that they are interacting with AI agents, explain agent capabilities and limitations, and provide clear escalation paths to human representatives, ensuring compliance with transparency requirements across federal and state regulations.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **SEC Reg BI:** Transparency obligations require disclosure of how recommendations are made
- **CFPB UDAAP:** Failure to disclose AI interaction could constitute deceptive practice
- **FINRA Notice 25-07:** Firms should consider disclosure when AI assists customer interactions
- **State AI Laws:** CA SB 1001, Utah AI Policy Act, Colorado AI Act mandate AI disclosure

---

## Control Description

This control establishes AI disclosure through:

1. **AI Identification** - Persistent disclosure that user is interacting with AI agent
2. **Capability Explanation** - Clear description of what agent can and cannot do
3. **Limitation Disclosure** - Transparent communication about AI limitations
4. **Human Escalation Path** - Clear mechanism to reach human representative at any time
5. **Data Use Disclosure** - Information about how conversation data is used
6. **Disclosure Versioning** - Track changes to disclosure language over time

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Implement AI identification in agent greeting and persistent throughout conversation
- Create capability disclosure template per agent type
- Configure "Transfer to Agent" action in Copilot Studio for human escalation
- Define data use disclosure aligned with privacy policy
- Document disclosure language in Agent Card (Control 3.1)
- Configure state-specific disclosures based on customer jurisdiction
- Version control all disclosure language with approval tracking

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | N/A - personal agents typically not customer-facing | No customer disclosure needed |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Basic disclosure for shared agents with external users | Shared agents may have external exposure |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Full disclosure suite; state-specific compliance; human escalation; capability limits; data use | Customer-facing requires comprehensive transparency |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Compliance Officer | Approve disclosure language, validate regulatory alignment |
| Legal Counsel | Review state-specific requirements, approve data use disclosures |
| AI Governance Lead | Configure disclosures in agents, manage versioning |
| Customer Experience | Design disclosure UX, test escalation paths |

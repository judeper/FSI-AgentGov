# Control 2.13: Documentation and Record Keeping

**Control ID:** 2.13
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, SOX 404, GLBA 501(b)
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish comprehensive documentation and record-keeping requirements for AI agents aligned with FINRA 4511 and SEC 17a-3/4 requirements, ensuring agent configurations, decisions, interactions, and governance activities are preserved in compliance-ready format.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Books and records requirements mandate documentation of automated system operations
- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Records retention requirements (WORM or audit-trail alternative per October 2022 amendments)
- **SOX 404:** Internal control documentation demonstrates control effectiveness
- **GLBA 501(b):** Administrative safeguards require documented information security program

---

## Control Description

This control establishes record keeping through:

1. **Record Categories** - Define categories: configuration, interaction logs, approvals, incidents, governance decisions
2. **Retention Schedule** - Establish retention periods per regulatory requirements (6+ years typical)
3. **SEC 17a-4 Compliance** - Configure WORM storage or audit-trail alternative per October 2022 amendments
4. **Document Taxonomy** - Create consistent classification and metadata standards
5. **Access Controls** - Restrict record access to authorized personnel
6. **Retrieval Procedures** - Document processes for regulatory examination response

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Create SharePoint site hierarchy for AI governance documentation
- Configure Purview retention labels: 6-year retention for agent records
- Configure SEC 17a-4 compliant storage (WORM or audit-trail alternative)
- Implement document metadata schema (Agent ID, Category, Date, Owner, Regulatory Reference)
- Configure auto-labeling for agent interaction logs
- Establish examination response procedures with designated custodians
- Schedule quarterly documentation completeness audits

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic documentation; standard retention; annual review | Low regulatory exposure, standard recordkeeping |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Comprehensive documentation; Purview retention; documented approval chain | Shared agents warrant formal records management |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | SEC 17a-4 compliance (WORM or audit-trail); automated retention; examination-ready documentation; quarterly audit | Customer-facing requires maximum recordkeeping rigor |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Compliance Officer | Define retention schedule, approve record categories, validate regulatory alignment |
| SharePoint Admin | Configure site structure, implement retention labels |
| Purview Records Manager | Manage retention policies, handle record disposition |
| AI Governance Lead | Ensure agent documentation completeness, coordinate audits |

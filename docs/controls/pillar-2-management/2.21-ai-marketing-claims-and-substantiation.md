## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA Rule 2210:** Requires fair and balanced communications; AI claims must be accurate and not misleading
- **SEC Enforcement Actions:** Delphia Inc. and Global Predictions Inc. settlements (2024) established precedent for AI washing enforcement
- **FTC Act Section 5:** Prohibits unfair or deceptive acts, including overstated AI capabilities
- **State Laws:** Various state unfair trade practices laws apply to AI marketing claims

## Control Description

This control governs the lifecycle of AI-related marketing claims from creation through publication and ongoing review. It establishes substantiation requirements, pre-publication review workflows, and ongoing monitoring.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Claims Inventory** | Central registry of all AI marketing claims across channels |
| **Substantiation Documentation** | Evidence requirements for each claim type |
| **Pre-Publication Review** | Compliance review workflow before external publication |
| **Performance Claim Validation** | Verification of AI performance assertions |
| **Ongoing Monitoring** | Periodic review of published claims for accuracy |

### SEC Marketing Rule Compliance

The SEC Marketing Rule applies to investment adviser advertising. For AI agents used in advisory contexts:

| Requirement | Application to AI Agents |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **No Material Misstatements** | AI capability claims must be accurate and verifiable |
| **Fair and Balanced** | Must disclose limitations alongside capabilities |
| **Substantiation Required** | Must have reasonable basis for performance claims |
| **No Cherry-Picking** | Cannot selectively present favorable AI outcomes |
| **Testimonial Rules** | AI-generated testimonials require disclosure |

### Claim Categories Requiring Review

| Claim Type | Example | Substantiation Required |
|------------|---------|------------------------|
| **Performance Claims** | "Our AI achieves 95% accuracy" | Validated testing methodology, sample size, conditions |
| **Capability Claims** | "AI-powered portfolio optimization" | Technical documentation of actual AI functionality |
| **Comparative Claims** | "Better than human analysts" | Controlled comparison study, disclosed methodology |
| **Predictive Claims** | "AI predicts market movements" | Backtesting results, forward-looking disclaimers |
| **Efficiency Claims** | "Reduces processing time by 80%" | Measured benchmarks, consistent measurement methodology |

3. **Technical Validation:** AI Governance Lead validates technical accuracy
4. **Legal Review:** Legal reviews for regulatory compliance (Zone 3)

6. **Publication:** Approved claim published with effective date recorded
7. **Periodic Review:** Claims reviewed quarterly for continued accuracy

## Objective

Establish comprehensive training and awareness programs for AI agent governance to ensure personnel involved in agent creation, approval, supervision, and oversight possess the knowledge and skills required for regulatory compliance.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4512:** Customer account information procedures require trained personnel
- **SOX 404:** Internal controls require personnel competency documentation
- **GLBA 501(a):** Information security programs require employee training
- **FINRA Notice 25-07:** Emphasizes need for qualified personnel to develop and supervise AI systems

---

## Control Description

This control establishes training through:

1. **Role-Based Curricula** - Define training requirements per role (maker, approver, supervisor, admin)
2. **Core Competencies** - Establish minimum knowledge requirements for AI governance
3. **Certification Requirements** - Define certification for critical roles
4. **Delivery Mechanisms** - Implement training via LMS, SharePoint, or Viva Learning
5. **Competency Assessment** - Verify understanding through assessments
6. **Ongoing Education** - Annual refresher and updates for policy changes

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Define training roles: Agent Maker, Agent Approver, Agent Supervisor, Platform Admin
- Create role-based curricula with specific learning objectives
- Configure training delivery platform (Viva Learning, SharePoint, or third-party LMS)
- Establish assessment criteria and passing thresholds (80% minimum)
- Track completion status in training records system
- Configure automated reminders for annual refresher
- Document training completion for regulatory examination

# Control 2.8: Access Control and Segregation of Duties

**Control ID:** 2.8
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** SOX 302/404, FINRA 4511, GLBA 501(b), SEC 17a-4
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish role-based access control mechanisms and segregation of duties (SoD) for AI agent governance. No single individual should be able to initiate, approve, and deploy agents to production without independent review.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **SOX 302/404:** Segregation of duties required for financial systems and internal controls
- **FINRA 4511:** Access to records must be controlled and logged
- **GLBA 501(b):** Restrict access to customer information through least privilege
- **SEC 17a-4:** Control over records modification with immutable audit logs
- **OCC 2011-12:** Separate roles for model development vs. validation

---

## Control Description

This control defines role-based access, approval workflows, and continuous access monitoring to prevent unauthorized changes:

| Capability | Description | FSI Application |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Role Separation** | Distinct roles for create, review, approve, deploy | SOX SoD requirements |
| **Least Privilege** | Minimum access needed for job function | Data protection |
| **Access Reviews** | Quarterly recertification of access rights | Audit compliance |
| **Just-in-Time Access** | PIM for administrative roles | Attack surface reduction |
| **Continuous Monitoring** | Real-time access analytics | Anomaly detection |

### Agent Governance Role Matrix

| Role | Create/Edit | Review | Approve | Deploy | Configure |
|------|-------------|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Agent Developer | Yes | No | No | No | No |
| Agent Reviewer | No | Yes | No | No | No |
| Agent Approver | No | No | Yes | No | No |
| Release Manager | No | No | No | Yes | No |
| Platform Admin | No | No | No | No | Yes |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Create security groups in Entra ID for each governance role
- Configure Power Platform security roles with appropriate permissions
- Implement Privileged Identity Management (PIM) for Zone 3 admin roles
- Build approval workflows that enforce SoD (creator cannot approve own work)
- Enable quarterly access reviews with auto-remediation
- Configure continuous access evaluation for Power Platform
- Monitor for stale accounts (no sign-in >90 days)

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Default user access; self-service; no SoD required | Low risk, personal use |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Team owner approval; Creator must differ from Approver | Shared agents require accountability |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Full SoD enforcement: Creator, Reviewer, Approver, and Deployer must all be different | Maximum control for customer-facing |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Security role configuration, environment access |
| Entra Privileged Role Admin | PIM configuration, access reviews |
| AI Governance Lead | Role definitions, SoD policy enforcement |
| Compliance Officer | Access review oversight, exception approval |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Security groups created for all agent governance roles
2. Power Platform security roles configured with appropriate permissions
3. No segregation of duties violations detected (run SoD check)
4. Quarterly access reviews scheduled and completing
5. PIM configured for admin roles in Zone 3 environments
6. Approval workflows enforce creator cannot approve own work

# Control 2.2: Environment Groups and Tier Classification

**Control ID:** 2.2
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, GLBA 501(b), SOX 302/404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Provide scalable governance by applying consistent policies across multiple Power Platform environments based on risk classification through environment groups and governance tier alignment.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Consistent recordkeeping controls across environments through transcript access and usage insights rules
- **GLBA 501(b):** Uniform data protection via sharing restrictions, authentication requirements, and IP binding
- **SOX 302/404:** Segregation of duties enforced through tier classification and solution checker blocking
- **OCC 2011-12:** Model risk management through external AI model restrictions and experimental feature controls

---

## Control Description

Environment Groups enable consistent governance policy application across multiple Power Platform environments. By grouping environments and applying rules, administrators can enforce sharing limits, channel restrictions, authentication requirements, and AI model governance at scale.

This control implements a three-tier governance model:

- **Tier 1 (Personal Productivity):** Individual experimentation and learning; non-sensitive data only; lowest blast radius
- **Tier 2 (Team Collaboration):** Shared team workloads and shared data sources; internal/confidential data; moderate blast radius
- **Tier 3 (Enterprise Managed):** Production and enterprise-managed workloads; may include regulated data; highest audit expectations

Environment groups work in conjunction with Managed Environments (Control 2.1) and Environment Routing (Control 2.15) to ensure makers are placed into correctly governed environments that inherit appropriate rules automatically.

**Critical Security Note:** Computer-Using Agents (CUA) must be **DISABLED** for all environment groups in FSI organizations due to significant security risks including data exposure, unauthorized actions, and audit trail gaps.

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Create environment groups aligned to governance tiers (Personal/Team/Enterprise)
- Configure sharing rules: disabled for Tier 1, enabled with controls for Tier 2/3
- Set authentication requirements for agents (required for Tier 2/3)
- Configure solution checker: None (Tier 1), Warn (Tier 2), Block (Tier 3)
- Disable external AI models and Computer-Using Agents (CUA) for all regulated tiers
- Enable usage insights and transcript access for audit trail support

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Apply baseline environment groups; document exceptions; disable sharing and external models | Reduces risk from personal use while keeping friction low |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Apply zone-aligned rules consistently; require named owner and approval trail; retain rule snapshots | Shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be consistently applied |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Require strictest configuration enforced via policy; treat rule changes as controlled changes with change tickets | Enterprise agents handle most sensitive content and highest regulatory risk |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Create environment groups, configure rules, publish rule changes |
| Environment Admin | Add environments to groups, manage environment-level settings |
| Compliance Officer | Approve tier classifications, review rule configurations |
| AI Governance Lead | Define governance tier requirements, agent-specific rules |
| IT Security | Review security rules (IP firewall, authentication, CUA settings) |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Environment groups exist for each governance tier (Tier 1/2/3) with descriptive names
2. All production environments are assigned to appropriate tier groups
3. Rules are published and show "Published" status with timestamp
4. New environments added to a group inherit rules automatically
5. Computer-Using Agents (CUA) rule is disabled for all environment groups

# Control 2.3: Change Management and Release Planning

**Control ID:** 2.3
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SOX 404, GLBA 501(b), SEC 17a-4
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish structured governance over all modifications to AI agents through controlled, documented, and approved change processes. This includes promotions between governance zones, configuration changes, version updates, and rollback procedures.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Requires records of all business activities - change records provide audit trail of AI system modifications
- **SOX 404:** Internal control assessment - change management demonstrates IT control effectiveness
- **GLBA 501(b):** Administrative safeguards - controlled changes protect customer information systems
- **SEC 17a-4:** Record preservation - change records retained per regulatory requirements

---

## Control Description

This control ensures that all modifications to AI agents are controlled, documented, and approved before deployment. Power Platform provides ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) pipelines for automated, governed deployments with approval gates, version tracking, and rollback capabilities.

| Capability | Description | FSI Relevance |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **ALM Pipelines** | Automated solution deployment | Controlled promotion |
| **Solution Versioning** | Track agent versions | Audit trail |
| **Approval Workflows** | Gate deployments | Compliance enforcement |
| **Rollback Capability** | Revert failed changes | Business continuity |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Enable ALM pipelines for Zone 2 (recommended) and Zone 3 (required) agents
- Configure approval gates per governance zone (Manager for Zone 2, CAB + Compliance for Zone 3)
- Implement solution versioning using semantic format: [Major].[Minor].[Patch]+[Config]-[Environment]
- Create configuration snapshots before any agent modification
- Define rollback procedures with clear decision authority matrix
- Maintain audit trail of all change requests, approvals, and deployments

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic change documentation recommended; pipelines optional | Low risk, personal use |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Pipelines recommended; manager approval; configuration snapshots required | Shared agents increase accountability requirements |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Pipelines required; CAB + Compliance approval; 48-hour review period; tested rollback | Customer-facing, highest regulatory examination risk |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Configure pipelines, manage deployments, target environment setup |
| AI Governance Lead | Define approval workflows, change classification criteria |
| Compliance Officer | Approve Zone 3 changes, verify regulatory requirements met |
| Security Admin | Security review for major changes, rollback authority |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. ALM pipelines are configured for all Zone 2-3 agents
2. Approval gates are functioning and blocking unauthorized deployments
3. All changes are documented with change ID, justification, and approvals
4. Rollback procedure can restore previous version within defined SLA
5. Audit trail captures complete change history for regulatory examination
6. Configuration snapshots exist for all Zone 2-3 agents

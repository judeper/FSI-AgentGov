# Control 2.6: Model Risk Management (OCC 2011-12/SR 11-7)

**Control ID:** 2.6
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** OCC 2011-12, Federal Reserve SR 11-7, FINRA Notice 25-07, SOX 302/404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

## Objective

Ensure AI agents used in customer-facing or decision-support roles are subject to the same rigorous governance as traditional quantitative models, including model inventory, independent validation, performance monitoring, bias detection, and documented change control.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **OCC 2011-12:** Establishes model risk management framework requirements for banks
- **Fed SR 11-7:** Requires model development, validation, and ongoing monitoring
- **FINRA 25-07:** AI fairness and transparency requirements for broker-dealers
- **SOX 302/404:** Internal controls must include documented model controls
- **OCC 2021-18:** AI/ML-specific risk management guidance

## Control Description

While Copilot Studio agents may not be "models" in the traditional sense, their use in customer-facing or decision-support roles requires similar governance:

| Capability | Description | FSI Application |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Model Classification** | Determine if agent qualifies as "model" | Tier-based governance |
| **Model Inventory** | Catalog agents that function as models | Regulatory examination readiness |
| **Independent Validation** | Third-party review of agent behavior | Compliance with SR 11-7 |
| **Performance Monitoring** | Track output quality over time | Early issue detection |
| **Agent Cards** | Standardized documentation of capabilities/limitations | Model transparency |

### Agent-as-Model Classification

| Criteria | Model Treatment | Example |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Makes decisions affecting customers | Tier 1 | Credit recommendation agent |
| Provides financial calculations | Tier 1/2 | Investment calculator agent |
| Customer-facing recommendations | Tier 2 | Product recommendation agent |
| Information retrieval only | Non-model | FAQ/knowledge base agent |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Classify all agents using OCC 2011-12 model definition criteria
- Maintain model inventory with tier assignments, owners, and validation status
- Create Agent Cards documenting capabilities, limitations, and performance benchmarks
- Establish independent validation program (third-party for Tier 1, internal for Tier 2)
- Implement performance monitoring with defined thresholds (accuracy, satisfaction, escalation rate)
- Implement manifest version control for point-in-time reconstruction
- Document all prompt changes with impact assessment and approval

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Non-model classification typical; minimal MRM governance | Personal productivity, no customer impact |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | May be model; internal validation; standard documentation | Shared agents may influence decisions |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Likely model; independent third-party validation; comprehensive documentation | Customer-facing, regulatory examination focus |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| AI Governance Lead | Model classification decisions, validation program oversight |
| Model Risk Manager | MRM framework alignment, validation scheduling |
| Compliance Officer | Regulatory requirements, examination readiness |
| Power Platform Admin | Performance monitoring configuration, manifest versioning |

## Third-Party Attestation {#third-party-attestation}

<a id="third-party-attestation"></a>

For Tier 1 agents in customer-facing or decision-support roles, consider engaging third-party assessors with expertise in financial services recordkeeping and AI governance (e.g., Cohasset Associates for SEC 17a-4, CFTC 1.31, FINRA recordkeeping compliance). See [Troubleshooting](../../playbooks/control-implementations/2.6/troubleshooting.md) for escalation guidance.

---

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. All agents reviewed for model classification with documented rationale
2. Model inventory maintained with current tier assignments and validation dates
3. Agent Cards created for all Tier 1/2 agents with performance benchmarks
4. Independent validation completed per tier requirements (annual for Tier 1/2)
5. Performance monitoring active with threshold alerts configured
6. Manifest version control enables point-in-time reconstruction

# Control 2.12: Supervision and Oversight (FINRA Rule 3110)

**Control ID:** 2.12
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA Rule 3110, FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-4, SOX 302/404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish supervisory procedures for AI agent outputs aligned with FINRA Rule 3110 requirements, implementing human-in-the-loop (HITL) review, sampling protocols, and documented oversight to ensure regulatory compliance for AI-assisted communications.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA Rule 3110:** Requires written supervisory procedures (WSPs) for all business activities including AI-assisted communications
- **FINRA 4511:** Supervision records must be maintained as books and records
- **SEC 17a-4:** Supervisory review documentation preserved for regulatory examination
- **SOX 302/404:** Management certification requires documented internal controls

---

## Control Description

This control establishes supervision through:

1. **Written Supervisory Procedures** - Document WSPs for AI agent deployment and monitoring
2. **Human-in-the-Loop Configuration** - Configure HITL requirements in Copilot Studio
3. **Sampling Protocols** - Define statistical sampling for output review
4. **Principal Designation** - Assign qualified supervisors per FINRA requirements
5. **Exception Escalation** - Define escalation paths for flagged outputs
6. **Supervision Evidence** - Maintain review logs for regulatory examination

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Create WSP addendum for AI agent supervision
- Configure Copilot Studio HITL: Enable generative answers review for Zone 3
- Set sampling rates: 100% for high-risk actions, statistical sampling for routine
- Designate qualified principals (Series 24 for BD, Series 66 for RIA) as supervisors
- Configure Power Automate workflows for review queue management
- Implement escalation triggers for flagged content
- Archive supervision decisions with reviewer identity and timestamp

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Self-service with periodic spot-check; annual WSP acknowledgment | Low external impact, minimal supervision needed |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Owner-level supervision; 10% sampling; documented review process | Shared agents warrant structured oversight |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Principal supervision; HITL for high-risk; statistical sampling; real-time monitoring | Customer-facing requires maximum supervisory controls |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Compliance Officer | Define WSPs, designate supervisors, validate regulatory alignment |
| Designated Principal | Execute supervisory review, approve/reject flagged outputs |
| AI Governance Lead | Configure HITL settings, manage review workflows |
| Agent Owner | Ensure agent complies with supervision requirements |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. WSP addendum documents AI agent supervision requirements
2. HITL configuration enabled in Copilot Studio for Zone 3 agents
3. Designated supervisors have appropriate registrations/qualifications
4. Review queue functions correctly with escalation routing
5. Supervision log captures reviewer decisions with timestamps

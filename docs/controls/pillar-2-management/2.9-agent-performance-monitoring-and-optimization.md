# Control 2.9: Agent Performance Monitoring and Optimization

**Control ID:** 2.9
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, GLBA 501(b), SEC 17a-3/4, SOX 404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization for AI agents to ensure reliable operation, service level compliance, and quality management. Financial regulators require demonstration that automated systems perform reliably and do not degrade over time.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Performance records support books and records requirements for automated systems
- **GLBA 501(b):** Monitoring protects customer information processing quality
- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Agent operation records preserved for regulatory examination
- **SOX 404:** Control effectiveness monitoring provides internal control evidence

---

## Control Description

This control establishes performance monitoring through:

1. **KPI Definition** - Define metrics (response time, error rate, resolution rate, CSAT, containment rate)
2. **Platform Analytics** - Enable Power Platform and Copilot Studio analytics
3. **Custom Dashboards** - Create Power BI dashboards for executive reporting
4. **Alerting Configuration** - Configure threshold-based alerts for degradation
5. **Anomaly Detection** - Implement AI-powered anomaly detection for Tier 3 agents
6. **Review Cadence** - Establish weekly/monthly/quarterly performance review processes

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Define performance KPIs per governance tier (response time, error rate, CSAT targets)
- Enable analytics in Power Platform Admin Center → Analytics → Copilot Studio
- Configure data export to Azure Data Lake for advanced analytics
- Create Power BI dashboards with KPI cards, trend analysis, and SLA compliance
- Set up Power Automate alerts for error rate > threshold (5%/2%/1% by tier)
- Enable Azure Monitor smart detection for Tier 3 agents
- Establish performance review meetings (weekly ops, monthly business, quarterly executive)

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic analytics; monthly review; error rate alerting only | Low risk, minimal monitoring needed |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Standard dashboards; weekly review; error rate and response time alerts | Shared agents need quality monitoring |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Full monitoring with anomaly detection; daily + real-time review; all metrics; 24/7 on-call | Customer-facing requires maximum visibility |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Power Platform Admin | Configure analytics, enable data export, manage dashboards |
| AI Governance Lead | Define KPIs, oversee review cadence, trend analysis |
| Operations Team | Monitor alerts, respond to degradation, execute optimization |
| Agent Owner | Review agent-specific performance, implement improvements |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Analytics data flows to Power Platform Admin Center reports
2. Power BI dashboard displays current metrics with working drill-down
3. Test alert triggers notification when threshold temporarily lowered
4. Performance review meetings scheduled with documented actions
5. Usage insights digest arrives at configured recipient addresses

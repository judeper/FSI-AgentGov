# Control 2.7: Vendor and Third-Party Risk Management

**Control ID:** 2.7
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), SOX 404, FINRA 4511, OCC 2011-12, Interagency Third-Party Guidance (2023), OWASP Agentic AI Top 10 (2025)
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

## Objective

Establish a comprehensive framework for identifying, assessing, and managing risks associated with third-party vendors and connectors used by AI agents. Vendor risk management addresses the unique risks introduced by Power Platform connectors, custom APIs, external AI services, and dynamic tool loading.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **Interagency Third-Party Guidance (2023):** Establishes lifecycle requirements for vendor relationships
- **OCC 2011-12:** Third-party risk management requirements for banks
- **GLBA 501(b):** Safeguard customer information through vendor controls
- **SOX 404:** Internal controls over vendor-provided services
- **OWASP Agentic AI Top 10:** Identifies agentic supply chain vulnerabilities as critical risk

---

## Control Description

AI agents frequently connect to external services, APIs, and data sources that may introduce security vulnerabilities, compliance gaps, or operational dependencies:

| Capability | Description | FSI Application |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Connector Inventory** | Catalog all third-party connectors | Regulatory examination readiness |
| **Vendor Risk Assessment** | Evaluate vendor security and compliance | Interagency Guidance requirements |
| **Contract Management** | Security clauses and SLAs | Contractual protections |
| **Dynamic Tool Governance** | Control runtime plugin loading | OWASP supply chain risk |
| **Ongoing Monitoring** | Continuous vendor oversight | Emerging risk detection |

### Connector Risk Categories

| Category | Examples | Risk Level | Assessment Frequency |
|----------|----------|------------|---------------------|
| **Microsoft First-Party** | Dataverse, SharePoint, Teams | Low | Annual |
| **Certified Third-Party** | Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow | Medium | Semi-annual |
| **Independent Publisher** | Community connectors | High | Quarterly |
| **Custom Connectors** | Organization-built APIs | Medium-High | Quarterly |
| **External AI Services** | OpenAI, third-party LLMs | High | Quarterly |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Maintain complete inventory of all third-party connectors with risk classifications
- Require SOC 2 Type II (or equivalent) for Zone 3 vendors
- Implement AI-specific contract clauses (model change notification, no training on customer data)
- Configure default-deny for runtime tool discovery and marketplace installations
- Map transitive data exposure for tool chains invoking multiple third parties
- Establish review cadence (monthly usage, quarterly performance, annual security)
- Document exit plans for critical vendor relationships

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Basic vendor inventory; standard terms acceptable | Low risk, personal use |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Formal questionnaire; SOC 2 recommended; quarterly monitoring | Shared agents increase blast radius |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Comprehensive vetting; SOC 2 required; continuous monitoring; audit rights | Customer-facing, regulatory examination focus |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| AI Governance Lead | Vendor policy, assessment criteria |
| Procurement | Contract management, vendor relationships |
| Security Team | Security assessments, technical review |
| Compliance Officer | Regulatory requirements, board reporting |

- [Troubleshooting](../../playbooks/control-implementations/2.7/troubleshooting.md) - Common issues and resolutions

---

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Complete connector inventory maintained with risk classifications
2. Vendor security assessments current for all Zone 2/3 connectors
3. Contracts include required security and AI-specific clauses
4. DLP policies block high-risk and unapproved connectors
5. Transitive data exposure mapped for tool chains
6. Quarterly vendor risk reports delivered to governance committee

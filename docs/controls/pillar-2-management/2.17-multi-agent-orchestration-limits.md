# Control 2.17: Multi-Agent Orchestration Limits

**Control ID:** 2.17
**Pillar:** Management
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 2026 Priorities, OCC 2011-12, Fed SR 11-7, SOX 302/404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish governance limits and monitoring for multi-agent orchestration scenarios where agents call other agents, delegate tasks, or operate in coordinated workflows, ensuring proper oversight and preventing cascade failures.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 2026 Priorities:** AI governance includes oversight of agentic systems
- **OCC 2011-12:** Combined model risk assessment required for interacting systems
- **Fed SR 11-7:** Multi-agent systems must be validated as composite models
- **SOX 302/404:** Financial controls must address automated decision chains

---

## Control Description

This control establishes orchestration limits through:

1. **Delegation Depth Limits** - Maximum levels of agent-to-agent calls (2-3 recommended)
2. **Circuit Breaker Patterns** - Automatic failsafe when cascading errors occur
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Triggers** - Conditions requiring human review in chains
4. **Financial Stop-Loss Controls** - Cumulative transaction limits across agent chains
5. **Orchestration Monitoring** - Track multi-agent interactions for audit
6. **Combined Risk Assessment** - Evaluate multi-agent systems as single models

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Define maximum delegation depth per zone (Zone 1: 1, Zone 2: 2, Zone 3: 3)
- Implement circuit breaker with error threshold (3 consecutive failures)
- Configure cumulative financial limits across agent chains
- Require HITL approval for critical actions in delegation chains
- Enable comprehensive logging for all agent-to-agent calls
- Create combined Agent Card for multi-agent systems
- Schedule quarterly review of orchestration patterns

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Single-agent only; no delegation allowed | Simplicity prevents complexity risks |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Max depth 2; circuit breaker required; logged interactions | Controlled orchestration for team use |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Max depth 3; full monitoring; HITL triggers; financial controls; combined validation | Customer-facing requires maximum orchestration controls |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| AI Governance Lead | Define orchestration limits, approve multi-agent patterns |
| Power Platform Admin | Configure technical controls, monitor orchestration |
| Security Administrator | Review circuit breaker events, validate controls |
| Compliance Officer | Approve financial limits, validate regulatory alignment |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Delegation depth limits enforced (test exceeding limit is blocked)
2. Circuit breaker triggers on consecutive errors
3. Financial stop-loss controls prevent cumulative limit breach
4. HITL triggers function at configured conditions
5. Orchestration logs capture complete agent-to-agent interaction chain

# Control 4.5: SharePoint Security and Compliance Monitoring

**Control ID:** 4.5
**Pillar:** SharePoint
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), SOX 404, FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Monitor SharePoint security posture, agent activity, and compliance status to ensure AI agents accessing SharePoint-based knowledge sources operate within established governance boundaries. This enables proactive identification of security risks, unauthorized access patterns, and compliance gaps.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Agent insights provide audit trail of AI access to records; continuous monitoring enables supervisory oversight
- **SEC 17a-4:** Data access reports verify content remains accessible for examination
- **GLBA 501(b):** Dashboard monitoring identifies security risks; agent access reports track customer data access
- **SOX 404:** Reports provide evidence for control testing; continuous monitoring validates control operation

## Control Description

This control provides visibility into how AI agents interact with SharePoint content, enabling proactive identification of security risks and compliance gaps before they become incidents.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Agent Insights** | Monitor AI agent activity across SharePoint and OneDrive |
| **Data Access Governance** | Comprehensive reports on permissions and sharing |
| **Dashboard Monitoring** | At-a-glance metrics on SharePoint Admin Center home |
| **Advanced Management** | M365 Copilot readiness and content management assessments |
| **Audit Logging** | Track file access, modifications, and sharing events |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Assign SharePoint Administrator role to monitoring personnel
- Enable SharePoint Advanced Management for Agent insights
- Configure Data access governance reports baseline
- Run Advanced management assessments quarterly
- Establish monitoring cadence by zone (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Integrate with Microsoft Sentinel for Zone 3 real-time monitoring

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Monthly Agent insights review; weekly dashboard review | Low risk; basic awareness sufficient |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Weekly Agent access review; monthly data access reports; alert on high severity | Shared agents need consistent monitoring |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Daily monitoring; SIEM integration; automated response; SOC alerting | Highest risk; continuous visibility required |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| SharePoint Admin | Report configuration and site settings |
| Security Operations | Threat monitoring and incident response |
| AI Governance Lead | Agent access review and policy enforcement |
| Compliance Team | Regulatory evidence and audit support |

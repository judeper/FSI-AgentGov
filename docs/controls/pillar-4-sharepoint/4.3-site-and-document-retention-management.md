# Control 4.3: Site and Document Retention Management

**Control ID:** 4.3
**Pillar:** SharePoint
**Regulatory Reference:** FINRA 4511, SEC 17a-3/4, GLBA 501(b), SOX 404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Manage the lifecycle of SharePoint sites and documents to ensure proper retention for regulatory compliance and timely disposition of content no longer needed. This prevents AI agents from surfacing stale or outdated information that could lead to regulatory violations or poor customer outcomes.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **FINRA 4511:** Requires 6-year retention for books and records; automated retention policies help meet this requirement
- **SEC 17a-4:** Non-rewriteable, non-erasable storage requirements; preservation lock prevents modification
- **SOX 802:** 7-year retention for audit workpapers and financial records
- **GLBA 501(b):** 5-7 year retention for customer information with secure access controls

## Control Description

This control establishes policies and procedures for managing SharePoint site lifecycles and document retention. For agent governance, retention management ensures AI agents access current, compliant content while expired or outdated materials are appropriately archived or disposed.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Inactive Site Policies** | Identify and manage sites with no recent activity |
| **Site Ownership Policies** | Ensure all sites have active, identified owners |
| **Document Retention Labels** | Apply regulatory retention periods to content |
| **Disposition Workflows** | Review and approve content deletion |
| **Agent Content Freshness** | Flag stale content to prevent agent access |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Configure inactive site policies (90+ days threshold) with notification and archive actions
- Create site ownership policies to identify and remediate orphaned sites
- Set OneDrive retention to 365 days minimum for regulated organizations
- Create retention labels for FINRA (6-year), SEC (6-year), and SOX (7-year) content
- Publish retention labels to SharePoint via label policies
- Coordinate with eDiscovery for legal hold integration

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Baseline retention where tenant-wide safety applies; document exceptions | Low risk; minimal friction for personal productivity |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Agent knowledge sources follow retention rules; require owner and approval trail | Shared agents increase blast radius; controls must be provable |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Strictest configuration; policy-enforced retention; change-controlled modifications | Highest audit/regulatory risk; enterprise agents need compliant content |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| SharePoint Admin | Configure site lifecycle policies and tenant settings |
| Purview Compliance Admin | Create and manage retention policies and labels |
| Records Management | Manage file plan and disposition workflows |
| AI Governance Lead | Ensure agent knowledge sources have proper retention |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Inactive site policy is configured and enabled in SharePoint Admin Center
2. Site ownership policy identifies orphaned sites and triggers remediation
3. Retention labels are published and visible to users in document libraries
4. OneDrive retention is set to 365 days or greater for regulated environments
5. Retention policies apply to agent knowledge source sites
6. Disposition workflows trigger review before content deletion

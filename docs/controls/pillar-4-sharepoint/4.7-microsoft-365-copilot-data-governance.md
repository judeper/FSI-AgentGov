# Control 4.7: Microsoft 365 Copilot Data Governance

**Control ID:** 4.7
**Pillar:** SharePoint
**Regulatory Reference:** SEC 17a-3/4, GLBA 501(b), FINRA 4511, SOX 302/404, OCC 2011-12
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish governance controls for Microsoft 365 Copilot (embedded AI in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams) including knowledge source governance, plugin management, user behavior guardrails, and output quality considerations. This control addresses the embedded Copilot experiences that access organizational data through Microsoft Graph and Semantic Index.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Record keeping for AI-assisted communications requires usage logging and retention
- **GLBA 501(b):** Content exclusions and access controls protect customer information
- **FINRA 4511:** Audit trail of Copilot usage supports books and records requirements
- **SOX 302/404:** Output review processes support internal controls over financial reporting
- **OCC 2011-12:** Over-reliance prevention addresses model risk management concerns
- **FINRA 3110:** Review requirements for Copilot-generated outputs support supervisory obligations

## Control Description

This control establishes policies for governing M365 Copilot, which differs from custom Copilot Studio agents in that it automatically accesses broader organizational data based on user permissions.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Restricted Content Discovery** | Exclude sensitive sites from Copilot via RCD |
| **Plugin Governance** | Control third-party integrations and approve new plugins |
| **Web Search Control** | Enable or disable web grounding per policy |
| **Usage Analytics** | Monitor Copilot adoption, usage patterns, and feature utilization |
| **Sensitivity Label Respect** | Ensure labels are honored in Copilot responses |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Track and manage M365 Copilot license assignments
- Configure Restricted Content Discovery for sensitive repositories (executive, legal, HR, M&A)
- Establish plugin approval workflow with security and compliance review
- Configure web search per governance level (disabled for regulated environments)
- Publish acceptable use policy covering permitted/prohibited uses
- Establish output review requirements by content type
- Configure usage monitoring in M365 Admin Center

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Standard Copilot access; self-review of outputs; basic acceptable use guidance | Personal productivity use is lower risk |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | RCD for sensitive sites; peer review for shared outputs; plugin approval workflow | Shared outputs require more oversight |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Comprehensive exclusions; strict plugin allowlist; mandatory external review; full audit logging | Enterprise-wide Copilot requires strictest governance |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| Microsoft 365 Admin | Copilot settings and license management |
| SharePoint Admin | Content exclusion configuration via RCD |
| Compliance Officer | Acceptable use policy and review requirements |
| AI Governance Lead | Overall M365 Copilot governance strategy |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Copilot licenses are inventoried with assigned users documented
2. Sensitive sites (executive, legal, HR, M&A) are excluded via RCD
3. Plugin governance workflow is established with approval process
4. Copilot query against excluded site does not return content
5. Usage analytics are accessible in M365 Admin Center
6. Acceptable use policy is published and accessible to users

# Control 4.6: Grounding Scope Governance

**Control ID:** 4.6
**Pillar:** SharePoint
**Regulatory Reference:** SEC 17a-3/4, GLBA 501(b), FINRA 4511, SOX 302/404
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Govern which SharePoint content is included in the Microsoft 365 Semantic Index for AI agent grounding. This ensures agents only access appropriate, authorized content and prevents inadvertent exposure of draft documents, archived materials, or content not intended for AI consumption.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **SEC 17a-3/4:** Ensures agents access only finalized records, not draft or incomplete documents
- **GLBA 501(b):** Controls agent data access scope to protect customer information
- **FINRA 4511:** Prevents agents from citing draft or unverified documents in responses
- **SOX 302/404:** Documents data governance decisions as part of internal controls
- **OCC 2011-12:** Ensures agent grounding on accurate, quality-controlled data

## Control Description

This control establishes policies for controlling which SharePoint content is indexed and available for AI agent grounding through the Microsoft 365 Semantic Index.

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Site Exclusion** | Exclude entire SharePoint sites from Semantic Index via Restricted Content Discovery |
| **Content Type Filtering** | Exclude Draft, Archived, or Personal content categories |
| **CopilotReady Tagging** | Positive governance with explicit approval for indexing |
| **Metadata-Based Rules** | Use site metadata to control index inclusion |
| **Audit and Monitoring** | Track what content is indexed and accessed |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Enable Restricted Content Discovery (RCD) on sensitive sites
- Exclude all sites with "draft", "archive", or "test" in the URL
- Personal OneDrive content excluded from organizational agent grounding by default
- Implement CopilotReady metadata for positive governance (explicit opt-in)
- Document grounding scope decisions for compliance
- Establish quarterly review process for grounding scope

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Personal OneDrive excluded by default; document personal site policy | Personal agents access only individual user content |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Exclude draft/archive sites; implement CopilotReady tagging; monthly review | Team agents need controlled access to shared content |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Explicit approval required for indexing; sensitivity label integration; quarterly attestation | Enterprise agents require strictest content governance |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| SharePoint Admin | Configure site exclusions via RCD |
| AI Governance Lead | Define grounding scope policy and approve changes |
| Compliance Officer | Review regulatory requirements for content access |
| Content Owners | Certify sites as CopilotReady |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. Site inventory is completed with Copilot exclusion status documented
2. Draft sites have RestrictContentOrgWideSearch = true
3. Archive sites are excluded from grounding scope
4. Copilot query against excluded site does not return content
5. Copilot query against approved site returns content appropriately
6. Quarterly review process is established and documented

# Control 4.2: Site Access Reviews and Certification

**Control ID:** 4.2
**Pillar:** SharePoint
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), SOX 404, FINRA 4511, NYDFS 500.07
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Establish periodic reviews of SharePoint site access to ensure only authorized users and agents can access sensitive content, with site attestation policies requiring site owners to certify that access permissions remain appropriate.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** Access reviews demonstrate appropriate access control management for customer information
- **SOX 404:** Attestation provides evidence of control operating effectiveness for internal control assessment
- **FINRA 4511:** Reviews ensure only authorized personnel access records, with attestation providing supervision evidence
- **NYDFS 500.07:** Reviews ensure access is limited to those with business need

---

## Control Description

This control establishes access governance for SharePoint sites, particularly those serving as AI agent knowledge sources. Key capabilities include:

| Capability | Description | FSI Relevance |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Data Access Governance Reports** | Snapshot reports on site permissions and sharing | Identify oversharing risks |
| **Site Attestation Policies** | Automated workflows requiring owner certification | Periodic access validation |
| **Entra Access Reviews** | Formal access review workflows with auto-remediation | Compliance evidence |
| **Service Account Auditing** | Review of AI agent service principal permissions | Least privilege validation |

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Generate Data Access Governance reports to assess current permission state
- Configure Site Attestation Policies for enterprise-managed sites
- Establish Entra Access Review schedules (quarterly for Zone 3, semi-annual for Zone 2)
- Include AI agent service accounts in dedicated review tracks
- Set up auto-remediation actions (read-only for non-attested sites)
- Archive attestation records for regulatory retention (6+ years)

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Annual review of broadly-shared personal sites | Baseline safety |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Semi-annual attestation with owner + manager review | Shared data accountability |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Quarterly formal review; Compliance + Legal sign-off; immediate escalation for non-compliance | Highest regulatory scrutiny |

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |

| SharePoint Admin | Configure attestation policies, generate access reports |
| Entra Identity Governance Admin | Configure access reviews in Entra ID |
| Site Collection Admin | Site-level permission management, respond to attestation |

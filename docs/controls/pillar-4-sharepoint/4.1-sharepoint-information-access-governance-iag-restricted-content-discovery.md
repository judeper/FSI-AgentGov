# Control 4.1: SharePoint Information Access Governance (IAG) / Restricted Content Discovery

**Control ID:** 4.1
**Pillar:** SharePoint
**Regulatory Reference:** GLBA 501(b), 504(b), SEC Reg S-P, FINRA 4511
**Last UI Verified:** January 2026
**Governance Levels:** Baseline / Recommended / Regulated

---

## Objective

Control which SharePoint sites and content Microsoft 365 Copilot and AI agents can access, preventing agents from discovering and surfacing sensitive content that users may have permission to view but should not be exposed through AI interactions.

---

## Why This Matters for FSI

- **GLBA 501(b):** Requires safeguards for customer nonpublic personal information (NPI); IAG prevents AI from surfacing NPI from restricted sites
- **SEC Reg S-P:** Mandates protection of customer information; controls AI access to customer data repositories
- **FINRA 4511:** Books and records integrity requirements; maintains governance over AI content access
- **SOX 302:** Internal controls over financial reporting; restricts agent access to financial reporting sites
- **Information Barriers:** Enables "ethical walls" required by FSI regulations to separate business units (M&A, trading, research)

---

## Control Description

This control establishes governance over SharePoint content accessibility to Microsoft 365 Copilot and AI agents. SharePoint Information Access Governance provides multiple mechanisms to control what content AI can access:

**Restricted Content Discovery (RCD)** is a block-list approach where administrators specify sites to exclude from Copilot. This is ideal for mature deployments with good data hygiene.

**Restricted SharePoint Search (RSS)** is an allow-list approach where only explicitly approved sites (up to 100) are accessible to Copilot. This Zero Trust model is recommended for initial Copilot deployments.

**Restricted Access Control (RAC)** enables ethical walls by limiting site access to specific security groups regardless of individual sharing permissions, ideal for M&A deal rooms, trading desk separation, and regulatory examination sites.

The control ensures that even when users have legitimate access to sensitive content, AI agents will not surface that content inappropriately.

---

## Key Configuration Points

- Enable Restricted Content Discovery (RCD) for all enterprise-managed and regulated sites containing sensitive data
- Consider Restricted SharePoint Search (RSS) allow-list approach for initial Copilot deployments (Zero Trust)
- Configure Restricted Access Control (RAC) for information barrier scenarios (M&A, trading, research separation)
- Run Data Access Governance reports to identify oversharing risks before Copilot deployment
- Document all restricted sites with business justification and review schedule

---

## Zone-Specific Requirements

| Zone | Requirement | Rationale |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Zone 1** (Personal) | Baseline tenant-wide IAG settings; document exceptions | Reduces personal use risk while keeping friction low |
| **Zone 2** (Team) | Apply RCD for shared agent knowledge sources; require owner approval | Shared agents increase data exposure; consistent controls needed |
| **Zone 3** (Enterprise) | Mandatory RCD for all regulated sites; RAC for information barriers; quarterly review | Highest regulatory risk; strictest content governance required |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| SharePoint Admin | Configure RCD/RSS/RAC settings, run Data Access Governance reports |
| SharePoint Site Collection Admin | Manage site-specific access restrictions |
| Compliance Officer | Approve restriction configurations, review audit logs |
| AI Governance Lead | Define policies for content accessibility to agents |

## Verification Criteria

Confirm control effectiveness by verifying:

1. All regulated/enterprise-managed sites have RCD enabled (RestrictContentOrgWideSearch = true)
2. Microsoft 365 Copilot does NOT return content from restricted sites when queried
3. RAC-protected sites deny access to users outside authorized security groups
4. Audit logs capture all IAG setting changes with user, timestamp, and site details
5. Quarterly review of restricted sites list is documented

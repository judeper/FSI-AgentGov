## Framework Principles

### 1. Risk-Based Governance

Controls scale with risk. Zone 1 (personal productivity) requires minimal oversight while Zone 3 (enterprise/customer-facing) requires comprehensive governance including committee approval, model risk management, and 10-year retention.

### 2. Regulatory Alignment

The framework maps controls to US financial regulations including FINRA 4511/3110/25-07, SEC 17a-3/4, SOX 302/404, GLBA 501(b), OCC 2011-12, and Fed SR 11-7. Organizations should validate mappings against their specific regulatory obligations.

### 3. Microsoft Platform Foundation

All controls leverage native Microsoft 365 and Power Platform capabilities. This framework does not require third-party governance tools, though organizations may integrate additional solutions.

### 4. Separation of Concerns

The framework separates:

- **Framework** (this layer) — Stable governance principles updated 1-2x per year
- **Control Catalog** — Control objectives and requirements updated quarterly
- **Playbooks** — Implementation procedures updated continuously as Microsoft portals change
